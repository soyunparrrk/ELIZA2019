If you want to have a flawless dirty talk phone date, then you have to make sure that both you and your partner are alone and ready to start having a sexy conversation. Your dirty talk won't go very far if you're ready in bed while your partner is having dinner with his mom. Plan your dirty talk date in advance so both of you are free and alone at home or in your rooms.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a2/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLook and feel sexy. Take a nice warm bath and put on some sexy lingerie and a hot outfit. Even if your partner won't be able to see what you're wearing, you'll be more easily turned on if you look ready for some action. You can even rub some scented oil or lotion on the nape of your neck to get you in the mood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9f/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-3.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSet the mood. Would you have sex with your dirty laundry all over your room and empty takeout containers all over your desk? Hopefully not. You shouldn't talk dirty until you're in a romantic atmosphere either. Just clean up your space, dim the lights and light some candles, and lie in your clean, welcoming bed. Do whatever you would do to prepare to get it on for real.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDon't overthink it. Before you pick up the phone or start getting turned on, don't stare at yourself in the mirror or analyze every last thing you'll say to your lover. Even if you're a dirty talk virgin, the process will feel more natural if you just sit back, relax, and get ready for what's to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/83/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nStart getting turned on. This doesn't mean you should touch yourself -- unless you want to -- but it does mean that you should start getting in a sexy mental space. Close your eyes and think of your most illicit sexual fantasy, or remember the last time it got really hot and heavy between you and your lover.\nIf it helps, you can lightly caress your body to get in the mood. But you should save most of that for your phone conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nStart Talking Dirty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/81/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nFind your \"dirty talk\" voice. It should still sound like you -- but like a sexier, slower-talking version of you.[3] Don't use the same voice you would use to ask your honey how his day went. Instead, talk a bit lower and more slowly -- you can even lower your voice to a near-whisper if you want to. Just make sure it still sounds like you to an extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/26/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGive your lover a few compliments. You don't have to say anything X-rated right away. Just start with a few basic compliments. Tell your special someone how much you've missed him, and how amazing his body is. You can even remind him of the last time you had sex and how hot it was. Just start saying nice things to your lover to get into the mood.[4] Here are some things you can say:\n\n\"I've been thinking about your toned arms all day.\"\n\"I miss you and your body so much.\"\n\"I love hearing your voice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/50/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-8.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTalk about what you're wearing. Tell your lover what you're wearing and describe it in great detail. Talk about how your body looks in your clothes, and mention any parts that are exposed. Ask your lover what he or she is wearing and close your eyes and imagine him or her in those clothes. Here are some ways to describe what you're wearing:\n\nFor women:\n\n\"I'm wearing your favorite bra.\"\n\"I'm not wearing any underwear.\"\n\"My dress is really tight around my chest.\"\n\n\nFor men:\n\n\"My shirt is tight around my biceps.\"\n\"I'm wearing that belt you love to take off.\"\n\"I'm wearing a button-down shirt. It comes off pretty easily.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-9.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTalk about what you would do if your lover was there. Start slow. Just say a few things that you wish would happen if your lover was there. You can get as graphic as you want, but you can start with the basics as you build toward your more elaborate fantasies. Here are some things you can say:\n\n\"I wish your arms were around me right now.\"\n\"I wish I could kiss your neck right now.\"\n\"If you were here, I'd start nibbling on your ear. You wouldn't be able to stop me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nGet Hot and Heavy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/06/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTouch yourself -- and describe how it feels. You can do this at any point while you're talking dirty. But the earlier you do it, the more turned on you'll be. Start gently stroking your own body and let your lover know what you're doing. Then, ask him or her to touch his or her own body and be detailed about what you want him to do. Just like real foreplay, you don't have to touch yourselves anywhere too untoward -- just start with a light touch that turns you on.\n\nAs you keep talking, you can start touching yourself in your erogenous zones.\nLet your lover know exactly what you're doing to your body. If you're caressing your breasts or stomach, tell him.\nDescribe all of the sensations you feel to your lover. If you start to feel a sexy shiver after lightly caressing your neck, describe it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1a/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTell your lover how you'd want him to touch you. Start talking about all of the things you wish your lover would do to your body until you're both bursting with excitement. Take turns telling each other what you wish you could do to each other. This can get more graphic than just saying what you want to do to your lover.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTalk about what you want to do to your lover. Let your lover know exactly what you would do to his or her body if you were there. Now that you're starting to get excited and to touch your own body, you can kick it up a notch and say whatever you want to do to his body, no matter how dirty it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/05/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTalk about how turned on you are. Don't be shy -- tell your lover how turned on you are just from talking to him and thinking about him next to you. Let him know that you're excited and that you feel it all over your body. If you're so turned on that you feel it in your toes, tell your lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-14-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nReveal your greatest fantasies. Once you're really excited, share your fantasy with your lover, no matter how dirty it may be. He'll play along and talk about it with you, helping you get more turned on as you picture yourselves enacting the fantasy together. Don't be afraid to put it all out on the phone line -- just close your eyes and start talking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTake off your clothes -- and talk about it. Don't just start stripping -- let your lover in on the peep show, button by button. If you're taking off your shirt, let him know that it's sliding over your head. If you're taking off your belt, let your lady know that you're dropping your belt to the floor. Paint a picture of your body that will turn on your lover even more.\n\nYou can also ask your lover to take off his clothes. Ordering him or her around will be extra hot. You can just say, \"Now take off your shirt\" or, \"I want you to pull down your skirt.\"\nWhen you start taking off your clothes, you can ask your lover for validation. As you're taking off your shirt, you can ask, \"Are you sure you want me to take off my shirt?\" This will help paint a visual image for your lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bd/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nMasturbate. If you just want to talk dirty just for fun or practice, then you can get off the phone and get off on your own. But if you really want to commit to talking dirty, then you and your lover should touch yourselves until you orgasm. If you want to keep things hot and heavy, you can announce your orgasm, and tell your lover that you're about to come. This will build anticipation and will turn both of you on even more. Once you've both orgasmed, you can say goodbye and look forward to your next dirty talk date.\n\nDon't be shy -- tell your partner when you're touching yourself, and let him or her know how it's making you feel. Be as graphic as you want.\nAs in real sex, it's pretty difficult to climax at the same time as your partner. If you climax first, just keep talking dirty to turn on your partner. Don't stop and ruin the mood. Keep talking dirty until both people are satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty on the Phone Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c6/Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/aid589016-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-on-the-Phone-Step-17-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nHave a sexy goodbye. Don't start transitioning into talking about how your days went; don't start telling goofy jokes, either. Just as you would cuddle after real sex, say some sweet, soft words to your lover and let him know how amazing he makes you feel. Get off the phone after a little while -- if you want to have a normal conversation with your lover, do it a bit later, so you can enjoy the sexy feeling after your dirty talk date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy","title":"How to Talk Dirty to a Guy","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nBuilding up to It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e7/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-1.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nConsider your guy’s personality. How comfortable is he with physical affection and romantic touching? How does he behave when you fool around? Is he fairly conservative, or does he love trying new things? What sort of language does he use in everyday life — is he okay with cussing?\n\nWhat you say while talking dirty will depend largely upon your partner’s personality — if he’s very conservative and/or doesn’t like swearing, you’ll want to be subtle.\nFor example, instead of saying “You look so hot right now, I can’t wait to get you alone,” you could say “Looking good!” and then give him a quick flirty kiss on the lips or — if he’s not into public displays of affection (PDAs) — on the cheek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-2.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTest the waters. Get a sense of how open to dirty talk he is but starting with things that aren’t overtly sexual. Dirty talk doesn’t have to be filthy. It can be as tame as texting him, “I can’t stop thinking about last night ;)” the day after you’ve fooled around.\nYou can even start with simply complimenting him more, for example, saying things like “That shirt looks great on you” or “I like that dimple there, that shows when you smile.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-3.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTouch him more often. Many couples aren’t physically affectionate outside of the bedroom. By touching him more often, you might be able to increase his desire and make him feel more comfortable with you and, as a result, open to trying new things.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7c/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-4.jpg/aid3566989-v4-700px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTalk about making out. If your partner is open to it, talk to him about what you’d like to try. Be respectful with what you say. Most importantly, never talk about making out right after you’ve done it, as this could make him associate your physical romance with having serious talks.[2]\n\nExample: “I love/really like/enjoy being with/etc. you, and I’d like to feel more connected to you. I was thinking maybe we could experiment a bit with talking dirty to each other.”[3][4]\n\nYou could even be more casual, and just say “What do you think about dirty talk?” You could say this while washing dishes together, making dinner, going for a walk — just NOT in the bedroom or after you’ve made out!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-5.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nGet a self-help book. If you’re finding it very difficult to bring up dirty talk, you might consider getting a book on it and bookmarking some of the pages. You could even tell your guy that you feel embarrassed talking about it, so instead you’re showing him what you want to talk about with a book.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-6.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nPractise talking dirty by yourself. It may feel really silly, but practising the phrases you'd like to say to him might help you feel more comfortable with saying them when you’re actually with him.[6]\nIf you aren’t comfortable talking dirty when you’re by yourself, you can also just practise being more vocal in everyday life — for example, if you eat something delicious, let out a little sigh of delight, or when he kisses you, make a happy little “Mmm” sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-7.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nTailor your talk to the situation. What you say and how you say it will depend on the result you’re hoping to achieve.\n\nIf you’re away from each other — perhaps both at school or work — and you just want to tease him a little, you could send him a text like, “I can’t stop thinking about how good you looked this morning/last night/etc.”\nIf you’re making out and he does something that you like, you could say “I love it when you do that.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-8.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nAlways be sincere. Whether paying a compliment, sending dirty texts, or talking dirty in bed, make sure that you mean what you say. Done right, talking dirty can improve intimacy and strengthen your relationship. Faking it will do the opposite. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nSending Racy Texts and Emails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nEase into the conversation. Don't bust out an R-rated text in the middle of a conversation about his family, dead dog, or otherwise inappropriate topic. If you want to initiate dirty texts, do it tastefully. Start off with something like \"I wish you were,\" or \"I wish I could be with you right now.\"\nThe key is to give him a chance to reciprocate before getting into the racier stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nDon't abbreviate. It may be the 21st century, but bad grammar will never be sexy (i.e. \"I want u 2…\"). If you have something good to say, spend the extra couple seconds it takes to spell it out completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/95/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-11.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAmp it up. Once you’ve established that he's into dirty texts, you can get dirtier and more explicit. If you're unsure of what level to take it to, take small steps and parallel what he does.\n\nEnding flirty texts with a winking emoticon ( ;) ) is common practice.[7]\n\nIf he doesn’t respond in kind to your text, it might be that he really doesn't get the hint, but it also might be that he doesn't want to go there. You’ll need to gauge his response based on what you know about him. It might even be that he’s acting like he doesn’t get the hint just to be funny. Example:\n\nYou: “I’m excited for dinner but part of me just wants to skip straight to ‘dessert’ ;)”\nHim: “Yeah! The restaurant has the best fudge brownie sundaes!”\nYou: “Hehe well I’m excited for those too — but that wasn’t really the ‘dessert’ I meant :P” or if you’re really unsure, you could just respond with “:P” which is vague enough that it should give him the hint you meant something else, but not completely confirm it (lest it makes him uncomfortable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-12.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSend flirty photos. What you send will depend on the relationship — it could be anything from a cute picture of you smiling to something that shows more skin.\nTry sending him a photo striptease: send a photo of yourself looking naughty with your clothes on, then photos of articles of your clothing (your shirt, your pants, etc.) as you take them off. Don’t send him a pic of yourself naked — let him imagine that![8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/40/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-13.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBe careful when sending pictures. Never assume that your private photos will be kept private. If you are concerned at all about everyone seeing you in compromising positions, don’t take the photos. At the very least, consider leaving your face out of the photos.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Snapchat is NOT a safe way to send sexy pictures of yourself. Apps exist that make it possible to permanently save Snapchat photos.\nEven if you completely trust your partner and believe that you will never break up, understand that if something goes wrong in the relationship, you might not be able to get those pictures back, and you won’t have control over who sees them — it’s possible that he could share them with others. It’s not fair, and ultimately it’s not your fault, but it’s a reality that you need to acknowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4f/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-14.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nDon't \"sext\" from your work computer.

If things are just getting started, it might feel unnatural to break out the dirty talk right away. If you don’t already do it, try moaning and sighing more while making out to express how good he makes you feel.\nIf you’re uncomfortable with moaning or you’re not sure how it should sound, start paying attention to the sounds you make on a regular basis — for example, maybe you let out an “Mmmm” or a little happy sigh when you eat something delicious. That can work in romantic situations, too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2d/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-16.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nStart with one word at a time. If you are normally on the quiet side when you’re making out, you probably aren't ready for full-on sentences yet. Start off with just one or two words at a time to show him you're enjoying yourself.\nExamples: “yes,” “that’s nice,” “oh god” (if you’re religious, you could say “oh my gosh” instead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d4/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-17.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nPay attention to how you say things. How you say things is as important as what you say — for example, if you say “I love that” in a bored, monotone voice, it probably won’t sound sincere to your guy. Speaking in a breathy or lower pitch can help you sound a bit sexier. Whispering things in his ear is also nice!\n\nThere is no need to cuss when engaging in dirty talk, so if you're really not comfortable with swearing, just don’t do it! “You’re so #@$!-ing hot\" can be just as affective as “You’re so hot.”\nIf you decide to speak in a lower pitch, be sure not to go too low — you don’t want to sound like your possessed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-18.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nCombine touch with words. Instead of saying “do you like it when I XYZ?” (XYZ meaning “fill in the blanks”) or “do you want me to XYZ?” do something and then ask him if he likes it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-19.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-19.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLet him know when he's doing something right. Men have a lot of pride when it comes to romance. If he does something in bed that you enjoy, then say so. It will not only make him feel good, but will also encourage him to do it again in the future.\n\nExamples: “yeah, just like that”, “that feels amazing/so good”[9]\n\nIf you want him to do something but are too afraid to ask, say \"I love it when you XYZ.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 20\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-20.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-20.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTell him how excited he makes you.

Want to send him over the edge? In a poll conducted by Cosmo magazine, men voted that the #1 hottest thing to say in bed is \"I'm coming.\"[10] Men love hearing this because a) it boosts their pride; b) it turns them on to know you’re going to come; and c) it lets them know that they can stop holding back and come too.\nBe sure that you’re actually coming before you say these words. If you say it when you don’t mean it, you’re not only lying to him, but if he comes as a result of it, you might end up stopping (or at the very least pausing) your make-out session!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 22\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-22.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-22.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nDon’t go over the top. If moaning doesn’t feel natural to you, it might be tempting to act how you think you should feel instead of how you actually feel; this can lead to over-acting. You don’t need to scream or gasp or be otherwise over the top to show how excited you are — doing so might even make you sound fake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 23\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-23.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-23.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n9\n\nPay attention to what he likes. If he enjoys what you’re doing, he’ll likely moan or tremble lightly, or even stop for a moment to collect himself before continuing to make out with you.\n\nIf your partner is uncomfortable with what you say, he might also stop, but for different reasons, and it will likely be clear just from his body language — pulling away from you, not smiling, losing his hardness.\nIf you two are able to communicate easily, he will likely just let you know verbally that he didn’t like what you said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty to a Guy Step 24\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-24.jpg/aid3566989-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy-Step-24.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n10\n\nBe patient. Figuring out exactly what to say when talking dirty to your guy could take some time.

Before you begin talking dirty, think about how to adjust your voice a bit to make it more conducive to sexy talk. Try to talk a bit slower and more softly. Don't use the same voice you would use to ask your lover if he/she took out the trash; find your own sexy bedroom voice.[1]\n\nBe aware, consciously trying to adjust the tone of your voice to be more sexy seems to work better for women then men, according to a Albright College study.[2]. So for men, it might be better to just talk naturally and let the voice come on its own.\nDon't expect to have the perfect dirty talk voice at first. Experiment with it. The more practice you get, and the more comfortable you get, the easier it will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Talk-Dirty-Step-3.jpg/aid543639-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBegin with some soft noises. Before you go into all-out dirty talk mode, just verbalize some moans, groans, or sighs to show how much pleasure you're feeling. Your might already do this. If so, great. If not, get comfortable with using your voice as well as your body in the bedroom.[3]\nEncourage your lover to make some noises too if they don't already; you don't want to be the only one moaning and verbalizing your pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cc/Talk-Dirty-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid543639-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive a few compliments. Start small. Just tell your lover how amazing he looks or how great he is in bed. Just say, \"You look amazing with your shirt off,\" or \"It feels so good to be with you tonight.\" You can give a compliment to a specific body part by saying something like, \"Your arms are so toned\" or \"I just can't get enough of your legs.\" Just make your lover feel sexy and appreciated.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/13/Talk-Dirty-Step-5.jpg/aid543639-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nStart with some soft-core dirty talk.

The easiest way to feel embarrassment or pressure when trying to talk dirty is to think of it as a performance. There's no wrong way to talk dirty; it should be an authentic expression of yourself.

Don’t be afraid to tell your lover how good he/she is making you feel. Even a simple, “I’m so turned on” can go a long way.

Of course, if you only enjoy dirty talk when it's going both ways, it might be better to forgo it completely.

Though you and your lover probably won't have a sit-down discussion about your expectations during dirty talk before your first sexual adventure, your boundaries should be communicated. You will probably start your first dirty talk session spontaneously, but at some point you should both make it clear if there are any words that make you uncomfortable.[15]\n\nIf your lover says something too crude or offensive for you in bed, don't stop and get angry. Just say something like, \"Please don't say that again.\" If your lover doesn't get the message, then you can stop the action.\nIf you're too embarrassed to admit that a certain word makes you uncomfortable during sex, mention it afterwards.

Of course, the dirty talk in porn may be a bit extreme compared to what you have in mind for your own bedroom moves, but it can help generate some ideas. \nIf you're both comfortable with it, try watching porn together with your lover.

Don’t call when you are hanging out with other people, and don’t put her on speaker phone without her permission.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive her your undivided attention. She is giving you the gift of her time, and you should do the same. Most young people believe that multitasking takes away from conversation.[4] Let her know that her conversation is the most important thing in the world. Don’t text, chat online, watch TV, or talk to other people while you are talking with your girlfriend. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nMaking Small Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGreet her cheerfully. Emotions are contagious.[5] If you sound friendly and eager to talk, she will likely respond in the same way. When she answers the phone, greet her in a way that opens up the conversation and tells her you want to listen. Use words that are appropriate for how close you are:\n\nHey! How's my girl doing?\nHi beautiful! How was your day?\nI’ve been looking forward to hearing your voice all day! What have you been up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLeave a sweet voicemail. If she doesn't answer and your call goes to voicemail, leave her a short and cute message. She will appreciate that you were thinking of her and enjoy hearing your voice.\n\nIf you have been dating for a while, you can say: Just calling to tell you I love you!\n\nIf you are in a new relationship, leave a more casual voicemail: I just wanted to see how you're doing! I miss you!\n\nLet her know the best time to call you back, so you don't wind up in a game of telephone tag: I'll be home from soccer practice at 7. Maybe talk to you then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nWarm up with casual conversation. People are social animals and are hardwired to crave small talk with strangers. Small talk creates a sense of connection as people get to know one another. Even superficial conversation can be meaningful in new relationships. Stick to easy topics that will put her at ease:\n\nShare a story from your day.\nAsk her about her favorite sports team.\nTalk about events at your school.\nDiscuss a TV show or movie you have both seen.\nIf the conversation gets boring:Don't: interrupt or abruptly end the call.Do: ask questions that lead to an interesting topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/72/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nCompliment her. Let her know you enjoy her conversation and her company. Without coming on too strong, say things that will encourage her to open up to you:\n\nYou tell the best stories!\nThat’s hilarious!\nI’m dying to hear what happened next!\n\nYou are so easy to talk to.\nDon't: repeat the same generic compliments every conversation.Do: say I love how excited you get talking about __.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nKeeping the Conversation Going\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nLet the conversation develop naturally. If you two have chemistry, small talk will flow into deeper conversation. Allow yourself to shift from casual banter to more personal subjects. Take advantage of openings that allow you to get to know each other better:\n\nI take guitar lessons too! Why did you pick guitar over all the other instruments in the world?\nYou get your license in three months? Where would you go if you had a car?\nSchool break is only two weeks away! Where are you going for the holidays?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/47/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe emotionally open. She will only be as honest and revealing as you are. Most people don’t express their true feelings because they fear rejection, not because they aren’t interested.[6] If you tell her know how much she means to you, she will feel safe to tell you the same.\n\nEvery time I see you my world lights up.\nYou are the most beautiful girl in this city.\nI feel like you understand me better than anyone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7a/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-10.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAsk open-ended questions. Frame questions so your girlfriend feels free to elaborate, provide backstory, and express feelings. Don’t stall the conversation with questions that she will likely answer with just yes or no.\nDon't: start with leading phrases like I bet you... or You must have...Do: use How..., Why..., and What... openers.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/08/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe a good listener. Conversations are two-sided, and listening is as important as speaking. Don’t interrupt or talk over your girlfriend. Pay attention to what she says, and wait until she has finished her thoughts to ask questions. Encourage her to share more.\n\nWhat happened next?\nHow did that make you feel?\nWhy do like In-N-Out milkshakes best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5e/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAvoid topics that stall conversation. You want to be honest with your girlfriend, but you don’t want to offend her or make her feel uncomfortable. Gauge her enthusiasm throughout the conversation. If she sounds excited about a topic, explore it more. If she becomes quiet or unsure and says I don’t know, Maybe or I guess a lot, steer the conversation to more enjoyable territory.\n\nIdentify sensitive subjects as you get to know your girlfriend better and stay clear. You want your conversations to be positive experiences. Dredging up bad memories (her parents’ divorce, an ex-boyfriend, her deceased grandmother) is not a shortcut to intimacy. Let her know she can tell you anything, but don’t stir up unhappy emotions deliberately.\nComing on too strong may scare her off. Don’t sound obsessed or overly needy. Don’t make comments about her body that are too forward and that she would not appreciate.\nDon't: be afraid to open up about your own emotions and life experiences.Do: pay attention to her comfort level, and adjust for future conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/82/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nMake plans about your future. Making plans together, whether for a night out or for a lifetime, creates closeness in a couple. Discuss where you would live and travel if you could go anywhere, what kind of dog you want, or what your dream home looks like. Have fun and use your imagination. Keep the conversation light and flirty: you don’t need to come up with a road map for your lives. Tell your girlfriend how much you look forward to your adventures together.\nDon't: start talking about marriage or moving in together before the topic has come up in person.Do: talk about your future in a playful way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 4\n\nSaying Goodbye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fb/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-14.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nEnd the conversation before you lose steam. It is always better to say goodbye while you still have things to stay to one another. You will look forward to your next conversation. Suggest what you can talk about on your next phone call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Your Girlfriend on the Phone Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg/aid1940343-v4-728px-Talk-to-Your-Girlfriend-on-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTell her you enjoyed talking. Let her know she is special and you appreciate her conversation. She will be more inclined to call you if she knows you want to hear her voice.\n\nI look forward to chatting with you soon!

Say something sweet just before you hang up that you know will make her happy.

You don't need to immediately say a well-rehearsed line.  Position yourself close to your partner's ear.[3] Once your intimacy has progressed, try saying something like this softly into their ear:\n\n\"Mmmmmm\"\n\"Ohhhhh\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"Ahhhh\"[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/86/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTurn it up a notch.[5] You don't need to say a whole sentence.  You're merely saying one or two words that will increase the intensity of what's going on in bed. You could whisper these into your partner's ear or even try saying them with a moan:[6]\n\n\"Keep going\"\n\"Wow\"\n\"Faster\"\n\"Deeper\"\n\"Harder\"\n\"Don't stop\"[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7c/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGo for full phrases. Once you've become comfortable saying simple sounds or easy phrases, you're ready to use full on phrases.  Both long and short phrases are effective and really vary on people and the situation.[8] If you are still unsure what you should say, try some of these out:\n\n\"You feel so good\"\n\"I want to feel you deeper\"\n\"I want to be yours\"\n\"I wish you could do that all night!\"[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSay what you are feeling.[10]  You don't have to be so mechanical about talking dirty during sex. Just say what you're feeling, what you're doing, or what you're experiencing in that moment.[11] As you start speaking dirty in the bedroom, try to avoid crude terms until you have a good idea of how your partner will respond.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3e/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nDescribe what works and what doesn't. Afterwards, take some time to go over what worked and what didn't.  You won't be an expert instantly, so you'll need to give your partner and yourself time to discuss your turn-ons and turn-offs.  The best time to talk about these is right after sex, when both of you are relaxed and want to be close.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4a/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTell them to talk back.  If you are feeling the urge, just whisper to your partner during sex, \"talk dirty to me.\" You may find that even this phrase will spice up the action.  There is also a chance that your partner is turned on by this invitation and could really move things forward.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/13/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nTalk dirty as a form of foreplay.  Many couples will initiate foreplay with speaking dirty to one another.  You could call your partner on the phone and tell them how you're excited to see them and drop a simple line like, \"I'd like to kiss and nibble your neck.\"[15]  Catching your partner off guard with dirty talk could lead to an exciting night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-8.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nExperiment with your voice.[16]  If it feels natural, modulate your voice when getting close to your partner.  Changing the way you say something in order to release what you are feeling can elevate both of your moods.  Whether you scream, whisper, or moan, release whatever you're feeling. Respect your partner and be careful not to put them out of their comfort zone.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nCommunicating Without Words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d3/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-9.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMoan when the feeling is right.  You don't always have to say words in order to spice up communication during sex. Researchers found that nonverbal communication is more linked to sexual satisfaction than verbal communication.[18]  Moaning is an easy first step, that won't feel too outside your comfort zone, but it will excite things.[19]\nDon't over-exaggerate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-10.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBreathe and sigh louder than normal.  Increasing the volume at which you breathe or sigh, will help your intimacy become more vocal.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4c/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-11.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nUse your body language.  You can communicate a lot to your partner by softly biting your lip. Body language can get points across in the bedroom, even if you're not trying to reveal something.[21]  Careful if you are prone to holding in your emotions because they'll come out through your body language.[22]  This is why it's important to be aware of your body language before sex and use it to your advantage during sex.\nWhat position you choose can say a lot. For instance, if you go on top, then you have full control of your pleasure and your partners'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-12.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nUse eye contact. Eye contact can speak the loudest if used at the right time in the bedroom.  It can be a great way to initiate things.  During sex, eye contact allows you to read your partner's facial expressions and help you gauge if things are working.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nRelaxing and Preparation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5c/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-13.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPractice relaxing activities. If you are not use to talking dirty in the bedroom, you might feel anxious or worried. These feelings can overwhelm your thoughts and cause your intimacy to be ruined.[24] Practice deep breathing exercises or even try yoga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bc/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-14.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nForget your worries about being sexy.  Focus more on the moment. If you're prone to feeling insecure you could prepare the bedroom or your wardrobe to boost your self-esteem. Set-up the mood lighting with candles or use a thin blanket draped over a light to dim the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b9/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-15.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nWatch true romance movies.  Don't get inspiration for talking dirty from porn.  Porn is a poor representation of genuine intimacy between a couple.  Watch a good movie like Match Point, Unfaithful, or Y Tu Mama Tambien.[25]  These are also great movies to watch with your partner that will get the blood moving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-16.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nHave fun!

Say them out loud to yourself or try using them in a sentence like normal. The more you become comfortable saying words like \"sexy,\" \"breasts,\" \"vagina,\" or \"penis,\" the less frightening the words are. They're just parts of the human anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nAdd verbs to your adjectives. Doing this will give your phrases an air of personality. Verbs commonly used are 'stroke,' 'squeeze,' 'suck,' or touch'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk Dirty in Bed Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/24/Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-18.jpg/aid457632-v4-728px-Talk-Dirty-in-Bed-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting","title":"How to Talk to a Girl by Texting","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nStarting Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nAsk for her number.

If she didn't personally give you her number, she's not going to expect you to text her. She could find it creepy that you got her number without asking her.\nAsking her over IM or the internet. Asking her in person will make it very hard for her to refuse. Unless she's really in control and plain doesn't like you, you should get the number 9 times out of 10.\nMaking a big deal out of it. The less it looks like you care about getting the number, the better off you should be. If you look like you really care about getting it, she could be a little put off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f1/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nIntroduce in your first text if she doesn't have your number. If she gave you her number and is waiting for you to text her, start off with something like this:\n\n\"Hey, it's Geoff from yesterday. How's it going?\"\n\"Hi there. It's Joey. Don't want to bother you long but have you seen this video? I almost died a second ago....\"\nOr try for something a little more self-consciously funny if you think you can pull it off:\"The guy who just embarrassed himself in front of you by trying to ask for your number? That's me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/38/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSend texts every now and then. Send texts gradually to see how she responds. Don't break her phone with hundreds of texts in the beginning. A few texts a day, followed by a break of a day or two, will show her that you aren't absolutely crazy about her (which can be a turn off for some girls).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nWait and look for signs that you're doing something right. We all have body language. You probably knew that. What you might not have known is that body language can bleed through texts. Signs that you're texting her the appropriate things include:\n\nQuick responses. Is she responding back really quickly whenever you text her? If she's playing hard to get, she might be purposely waiting, so don't put too much stock in this.\nLaughter and other emoticons. Is she laughing all the time with \"haha\" or \"lol?\" That's a good sign. Smiley faces and other emoticons are definitely good signs, too.\nFlirting back with you. You'll know a flirt when you see one. If she texts you something like \"Oh I wouldn't have missed it for the world,\" or \"Anytime I talk to you, it's a good day\" means you're doing something good. Keep it up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/71/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nPay attention to signs that she's not as interested as she could be. Just like there are positive signs that you should be picking up on, there are negative signs that you can pick up on, too. Pay attention to these as you begin texting.\n\nShe doesn't respond to some of your texts. She just plain ignores them. If you said something impolite or insensitive, make a mental note not to text that again. Try giving her a little more space.\nShe writes back with very few words. If you sent her a couple of really nice, well thought-out texts, and she just responds with \"That's nice,\" it means she's not in the mood or doesn't think what you wrote is very interesting.\nShe's never the one to start texting you. If you always have to text her, and she never makes an effort to text you, things probably aren't going great — yet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nGetting Comfortable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nThink about the sort of things that you want to text her. It can be a good idea to start with generic things and build up to more personal things over time.\n\nFor example, you might tell her about upcoming parties and events at the start.\nLater, you can send texts telling her what you're doing and where you're going.\nFinally, you can send texts just letting her know that you're thinking about her and the sorts of things you like/love about her. (Do this only if you're in a relationship or you're not worried that she'll find that uncomfortable.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e9/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTry to put humor into your writing. Texting her funny things will help make texting much easier. If you're a funny person, use that. If you're not, try developing inside jokes, playfully teasing her, or simply commenting on funny situations you both are part of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ab/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe sure to read what her texts say. Respond to questions that she asks and also respond in a way that shows that you have read and taken in the things that she has been texting generally. She'll like that.\nDon't always respond immediately every time she texts you. Wait a couple of minutes before you text back. Switch it up. Sometimes, wait a big longer, sometimes a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/05/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDon't always try to flirt with her. Don't lay it on thick, all day, every day. If you've started flirting with her, do it sparingly. A little bit will go a long way. Learn to make your texts a little more diverse by texting about:\n\nHer day-to-day life. \"Hows it going?\" \"How was your day?\" and \"Do anything fun over the weekend?\" are all normal texts.\nAny problems she is dealing with. Let her come to you with the problems. Don't pry into her life. But try to offer advice if she seems open to it.\nThings that are happening in your life. You're probably giving her a lot of attention, and that's fine. But maybe, just maybe, she wants to learn about what's happening to you. Share what you're doing, who you saw, and where you're going. A little goes a long way here. Don't get carried away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl by Texting Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/86/Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid757866-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-by-Texting-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBe sure to eventually move beyond texting. If you start to develop a relationship with a girl, don't just rely on texting forever and ever. Eventually, you're going to need to move past texting and start hanging out with her, calling her on the phone, and going out on dates. If this girl likes you, that's what she'll expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nSample Texts\n\n\n\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Text-to-Girl-About-Dance.png/340px-Text-to-Girl-About-Dance.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nSample Text to Girl About Dance\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Text-to-Girl-About-Relationship.png/340px-Text-to-Girl-About-Relationship.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nSample Text to Girl About Relationship\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Ask-Your-Girlfriend-to-Stop-Talking-to-a-Guy","title":"How to Ask Your Girlfriend to Stop Talking to a Guy","content":["\n\nMethod 1\n\nHaving the Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Calm Down a Jealous Girlfriend Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f0/Calm-Down-a-Jealous-Girlfriend-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Calm-Down-a-Jealous-Girlfriend-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nExplain your feelings with \"I\"-statements. As this is a delicate situation, phrasing things using \"I\"-statements can help reduce tension as you place the focus on your feelings. Begin with \"I feel...\" and state your feeling. Then, explain the behavior that led to that feeling and why you feel the way you do.[1]\n\nDon't come into the situation and say something like, \"It's hurtful that you're so flirtatious with your ex and it makes me insecure.\" This can sound hostile.\nInstead, calmly rephrase the above sentiment using an \"I\"-statement. For example, say, \"I feel uncomfortable when you're very touchy and affectionate with your ex because it makes me feel like the two of you still have feelings for each other.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Promise Ring Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b5/Buy-a-Promise-Ring-Step-21.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Buy-a-Promise-Ring-Step-21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe matter of fact. After explaining your feelings, be direct and matter of fact about what you want.[2] Remember, there is no guarantee she will be receptive. It's probably better to ask her to lessen contact or tone down interactions than demand she not talk to him at all. \nSay something like, \"I would feel more comfortable if the two of you didn't talk as much, or if you toned down some of the physical affection, especially in my presence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Admit Cheating on a Loved One Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Admit-Cheating-on-a-Loved-One-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Admit-Cheating-on-a-Loved-One-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive her a chance to talk. Asking your girlfriend to change her relationship with someone is a very sensitive topic. It's important your girlfriend has a chance to share how she feels as it is still her decision. After making your case, let her respond without interrupting her.[3]\n\nGive non-verbal cues to show you're listening, such as maintaining eye contact and nodding on occasion.\nIt can also help to paraphrase what she's said to make sure you understand. For example, say, \"So, you feel like the relationship is still important because the two of you were friends before you dated. Is that what you're saying?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Apologize to a Girl Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/99/Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-8.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nRemain calm. Yelling, making accusations, calling names, and being otherwise hostile is not going to help the situation.  It can be hard to stay calm during a confrontation, but take some deep breaths. Remember, you're trying to improve your relationship and not start a fight.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Stop Being Jealous Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/03/Stop-Being-Jealous-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Stop-Being-Jealous-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nStay in the present. You're talking about a situation that is occurring right now. You are not discussing the past or other issues, so do not bring these things up. This is likely to make your girlfriend feel judged and get defensive.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Calm Down a Jealous Girlfriend Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Calm-Down-a-Jealous-Girlfriend-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Calm-Down-a-Jealous-Girlfriend-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nBe willing to compromise. It's very unlikely your girlfriend will flat out agree to stop speaking to someone as in this you are asking them to break bonds with someone else and this can be a large thing to ask. Therefore, you need to be willing to compromise. Find a solution where you both get what you want to some degree.[6]\nFor example, you could agree to let your girlfriend stay friends with her ex. She could agree to set firmer boundaries and be less physically affectionate with him. This could be a win-win situation for both of you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nDeciding If and How You Should Ask Her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get Over Your First Love Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/70/Get-Over-Your-First-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Get-Over-Your-First-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMake sure you're being fair. If you're worried about your girlfriend talking to a guy because he gives you bad vibes, it's appropriate to tell her so. However, if you're simply being jealous, it's not always a good idea to request your girlfriend stay away from a guy. This can easily backfire.[7]\n\nIf you're feeling jealous, look at the situation from a rational perspective. Is your girlfriend really going to be receptive to you asking her to not talk to a guy simply because you're insecure? Probably not.\nThink about if your jealousy is even related to the guy, or if it’s part of a bigger issue. For example, maybe your jealousy is actually a reaction to your girlfriend being busier than usual.\nIf jealousy is the main culprit, it's better to have a conversation about why you're feeling jealous and how the two of you can cope as a couple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Apologize to a Girl Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nPut yourself in your girlfriend's shoes. In any difficult conversation, empathy is key to successfully talking things out. Before you talk to your girlfriend, sit down and put yourself in her shoes. Try to imagine where she's coming from.[8]\n\nFor example, maybe she talks to an ex-boyfriend and the two often seem flirtatious with each other. While this behavior may feel hurtful to you, perhaps your girlfriend sees it differently.\nThink about how your girlfriend may see this situation. Is she generally affectionate with other friends, regardless of gender? If so, this may simply be how she acts with everyone. She may not see the relationship as a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Apologize to a Girl Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-12.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Apologize-to-a-Girl-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nWrite down your thoughts. Take a piece of paper and a pen or pencil. Jot down your thoughts and feelings on the situation. Then, read over the words you wrote down and think about how you could verbally express them. As it's often hard to express yourself during a stressful conversation, having some idea of what to say can help.[9]\nYou should not write down what you want to say word for word. It's important to leave some room for flexibility. However, having a rough idea of how you'll phrase things can help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled End a Conversation With a Girl Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/End-a-Conversation-With-a-Girl-Step-6.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-End-a-Conversation-With-a-Girl-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nRelease any expectations you have. If you go into a conversation with specific expectations, you may become frustrated or angry if things unfold differently. You cannot tell the future and you don't know how your girlfriend will react. Releasing expectations can help you go into the situation willing to listen and accept your girlfriend's reactions.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nOvercoming Your Jealousy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Hang out With Your Girl Friends when You're the Only Guy Around Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d1/Hang-out-With-Your-Girl-Friends-when-You%27re-the-Only-Guy-Around-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Hang-out-With-Your-Girl-Friends-when-You%27re-the-Only-Guy-Around-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTake responsibility for your feelings. Unjustified jealousy is your problem and not your girlfriend's. If your girlfriend is not cheating on you or violating your boundaries, you're the one who needs to work on your jealousy. Own up to the fact you're being jealous and do not place the blame on external factors.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Become a Book Editor Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Become-a-Book-Editor-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Become-a-Book-Editor-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nRemember your good qualities. Jealousy often stems from low self esteem. When you're feeling jealous, remember the good things about yourself. Jot down a list of your best qualities to bring yourself up.[12]\nIt can also help to remind yourself why your girlfriend wants to be with you. Does she say she loves your sense of humor or your kind personality? Keep this in mind, as it can curb feelings of jealousy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Catch a Cheating Partner Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/62/Catch-a-Cheating-Partner-Step-13.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Catch-a-Cheating-Partner-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAssess your jealousy. Jealous people are often chronically insecure. They also may have issues from their past contributing to jealousy. Did you struggle to make attachments to caregivers early in life? Have you been cheated on before, or did one of your parents cheat on the other?[13]\nIf there are major issues contributing to your jealousy, see a therapist to sort them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Reduce Stress As a Teenage Boy Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Reduce-Stress-As-a-Teenage-Boy-Step-16.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-As-a-Teenage-Boy-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nManage your emotions in a healthier fashion. Making demands of your girlfriend is not the best means to deal with your jealousy. When you feel jealous, find healthier ways to regulate your emotions.[14]\n\nWhen your thoughts start to get out of control, ground yourself in the present with mindfulness. Tune into your senses and notice the pattern of your breathing.\nTry other stress reduction techniques as well. Journal, exercise, or  watch a movie to get your mind off your thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Reduce Stress with Adult Coloring Books Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Reduce-Stress-with-Adult-Coloring-Books-Step-2.jpg/aid9000621-v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-with-Adult-Coloring-Books-Step-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nDevelop interests outside your relationship. If your relationship is the only thing you have going for you, you're more likely to obsess over it. Build up relationships with friends and family members. Take up a hobby or join a club. This way, you'll have more to focus on than your girlfriend's relationship with other men.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone","title":"How to Talk to a Guy over the Phone","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nCalling Your Crush\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nThink of what to say.

Maybe you are in class together and you need some help on an assignment. You can write down a list of topics to go through, but don't rely on that too much. You want to make it casual and impromptu.\n\nAsk him things like \"How did baseball practice go last night?\" or \"What are you writing your term paper about?\" to get him talking about things he loves or knows. These are open enough that he can elaborate and will get him talking.\nMake sure to focus on a few topics that you know a little bit more about as well.

You are more likely to be relaxed and confident in your conversation.\nIt might not just be you that's nervous.

Whether he picks up, someone else picks up, or he isn't there, think about what you are going to say. When he answers the phone, give a casual but excited greeting. Since you've never talked to him on the phone before, make sure you mention who it is, saying something such as \"Hi, this is Mary. How have you been?\". People generally sound different on the phone than they do in real life.[3]\n\nIf someone other than the guy answers the phone, don't be nervous to ask for him. Just be polite and ask if he is available.\nIf you get his voicemail, stay calm. Leave a message, letting him know who you are, your number, and that you want him to call you back. If you think your date is silly or fun enough, you can leave a goofy message for him, something along the lines of \"If you can't reach me when you call, I might be out, or I might have gotten abducted by aliens.\" It shows that you know what kind of guy he is and that you're not too serious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAsk engaging questions. Ask questions that have more than one word answers, such as \"What do you think of the movie you saw last weekend?\" or \"What is the best part of that new game I heard you bought?\". This is the time to use the list of topics you thought about before you called him. Find a way to bring up those topics and then ask him questions about them. This gets him talking about his interests and lets him know you noticed him.[4]\nTry to avoid questions like \"What's up?\". They are very vague and don't give the conversation anywhere to go. Also avoid asking what his favorite food or color is. These questions are really common and won't make you seem interested or interesting. This is the time to show him how great you are.[5]\n\n\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Pompey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelationship Expert\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Pompey is a Relationship Expert with over 10 years of helping people navigate the online dating world.

Pretty much everybody has been on a bad date at some point in their life, or maybe you've received creepy messages online. Sharing those can give you something to talk about, but at the same time, it helps show that you're not like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/62/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nListen. You don't want to monopolize the conversation, so make sure you listen to him as much as you talk. No one likes it when they spend the entire time on the phone and can't get a word in. Also pay attention when he's answering the questions you ask him. Respond to things he says, giving your input when needed or laughing when he makes a joke or says something funny.\nEven if you have something you really want to say, make sure you don't interrupt him. You don't want to seem rude and want to give him plenty of time to get his thoughts out. He would probably love to hear what you have to say, just wait until the right time to give your response.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/99/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nAnswer thoughtfully. Pay attention to the questions he asks you. Give adequate, lengthy responses that fully answer his questions. If you give clipped, short answers, he might think you aren't interested. You want him to know that you are paying attention and that you want to keep talking. Also try to incorporate some of your interests into your responses, with topic starters like \"I've never played that video game, but I'm really love playing strategy board games.\" These give him little hints about you and will help you two get to know one another. [8]\n\nDon't overshare. You want to keep some things to talk about at a later time, hopefully when he asks you out on a date. You also want to keep him interested.[9]\n\nTry not to sound cocky. You don't want him to think you're arrogant or showing off too much. This could make him think twice about calling you in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9d/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nKeep the call short. Find a natural place to end the conversation without sounding rude. You can either use a real or fake excuse, but cut off the conversation when it is still going well. This will leave him wanting more and will encourage him to call you next time. Try to say things like \"I had a great time talking to you, but I'm meeting my friends for coffee in half an hour.\" This let's him know that you like him but also lets him know you aren't going to be sitting at home waiting by the phone.[10]\n\nYou don't want to keep him on the phone too long. If either of you are pausing too long or are trying to fill the silence, it means you've probably gone on too long. Try to figure out a way to pick up the conversation before you hang up. You don't want to leave it on a low note.[11]\n\nMost guys don't talk on the phone that much, so an extended conversation might not be his thing. You also don't want to run out of things to say.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nTalking to Your Boyfriend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nRelax. Even if you are dating someone, calling them can still be nerve-racking. Just remember to be calm. Since he is your boyfriend, you don't have to stress as much, even if the relationship is new. You know he likes you and should be happy to talk to you on the phone.\nMake sure you're in a comfortable and quiet place. You are more likely to be relaxed and will be able to talk longer without interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5e/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nThink of things to say. If the last few times you talked were filled with silences, think about things you want to know about you boyfriend before you call him. Is there a game you know he just bought that he's been playing? Ask him if and why he likes it. Try to remember small details that he's brought up when you were last together, such as \"How did that paper turn out that you were working on a few days ago?\" This way, he knows you pay attention to him when you're together and knows you care.\nThis is especially helpful if you find that you've run out of things to say the last few times you've been together or talked on the phone. This doesn't mean that the relationship isn't working, but it could just mean that you're both shy or that you two don't know each other that well yet.\n\n\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Pompey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelationship Expert\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Pompey is a Relationship Expert with over 10 years of helping people navigate the online dating world.

Don't wait around for him to call you. Just because he's the guy, that doesn't mean that he is the one initiating everything. Calling him lets him know you're thinking about him, that you care, and that you are still interested in him.\nMake sure you don't call him too much. This seems clingy and you don't want to suffocate him. Keep it balanced.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dc/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAsk about important things. Don't be afraid to ask personal or difficult questions. Ask him what his future goals are, what his life's ambition is, or what he is most scared of in the world. Try phrasing it in a way that makes it open ended for him to fill in as much detail as he wants, such as \"I know you're majoring in civics. What would be your dream job?\". This lets him know you care about him on a personal level and that you want to know all the different parts of his personality.[14]\nDon't ask him where he thinks the relationship is going or other questions dealing with your relationship. This might scare him off or make him uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy over the Phone Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/44/Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg/aid7079-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-over-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAnswer thoughtfully.

Pick things that you know you both have in common. This way, you both will have something to contribute to the conversation and you can find some common ground. By giving your perspective, you let him know that you have your own mind while still having similar interests to him.[17]\nDon't bring up topics that you know you disagree on. If he does, don't lie and tell him you agree with him, but steer the conversation back to a safer topic with phrases like \"I don't necessarily agree with that policy, but I do agree with your stance on that new health bill.\" You don't want to start a fight or bring unnecessary strife to your phone conversation.\n\n\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Keegan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDating Coach\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Keegan is a dating coach and motivational speaker based in New York City.

You want him to know that you don't always have to be in control of the conversation.\nDon't be afraid of silences. Just because there is a pause in conversation, this doesn't mean that the phone call is going badly. Silences can mean that you're becoming more comfortable with one another and that you just enjoy being in each other's presence.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like","title":"How to Talk to a Guy You Like","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nStriking Up A Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nRehearse what to say if you're nervous. It can be scary to start up a conversation with your crush. It may feel silly to you, but may be people find rehearsing what to say ahead of time can help. If you're unsure how to approach your crush, stand in front of the mirror in your home and practice.[1]\n\nTry to think of ways to start a conversation. Where do you normally see this person? If you have class together, you can practice asking him about a homework assignment or making a comment on the latest test.\nYou don't have to plan what you'll say word-for-word. In fact, rehearsing too much may make your conversation sound strained. Instead, have a general idea of what you want to talk about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nFind a conversation starter. Look for observations or comments you can make to get the conversation started. There are a variety of ways to begin a conversation. Once you're talking, you can proceed to keep things flowing, allowing you to get to know your crush.[2]\n\nTry starting with a compliment. For example, say something like, \"Hey, I love your sweater.\"\nYou can also make an observation. For example, \"What did you think of that quiz yesterday? I thought it was really tough.\"\nYou can ask a question. For example, \"Do you know when that report is due? I forgot to write it down.\"\nTry to approach him in comfortable situations. If he's not distracted, it will be easier to get his attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAsk questions. Once you start talking, ask some questions. It can be difficult to establish a smooth flow of conversation at first. One helpful tip to remember is that people generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you want your crush to keep talking, ask him questions. This can also help you get to know him better.[3]\n\nAsk him about things you have in common, at first. For example, \"What do you think of this class?\" and, \"Do you think you'll go to the football games this season?\"\nOnce you're in a conversation, try to ask more broad questions that relate to the topic at hand. If you end up discussing a movie you watched in class, say something like, \"What kind of movies do you like in general?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7f/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nMaintain the conversation for an appropriate amount of time. During the initial conversation, you don't want to overdo it. Pay attention to how the guy is reacting. Wrap up the conversation when it seems to have reached its natural end.[4]\n\nAfter you exhausted a certain topic, you both may get the sense there's little left to discuss. The guy may start giving shorter answers.\nThis isn't necessarily a sign the guy is not engaged. Conversations just have a natural beginning and end. Rather than trying to force a conversation to go on longer than it has to, try to wrap it up. Look for an organic way to exit the conversation. For example, say something like, \"Well, I should head to my next class. I'll see you later.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nCommunicating Regularly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/db/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nDiscuss shared interests. You want to be yourself around your crush, so don't center all the conversations around him and his interests — let him get to know you, too. Once you're talking regularly, try to look for shared interests to discuss. This way, you'll get to know each other better and bond through common traits.[5]\n\nFor example, say you find out you both like Dancing With The Stars. Try asking him about the latest episodes after they air. For example, \"Did you see Dancing With The Stars last night? It was so crazy.\"\nFrom there, you can look for broader topics of shared interests to discuss. For example, \"Do you like dancing? I just love dancing and musicals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGet to know him by asking questions. If a conversation is slowing down, ask a question. Asking someone about themselves will usually keep a conversation interesting. This will also give you a sense of whether you want to eventually ask your crush out. If you have a lot of shared interests and opinions, you're more likely to be compatible. You can ask questions like:[6]\n\n\"What's your favorite movie?\"\n\"Do you have any hobbies?\"\n\"What's your favorite subjects in school?\"\n\"What's the coolest place you've ever visited?\"\n\"Who's your favorite television character?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe yourself. When you really like someone, it can be very tempting to try and be the type of person you think they would be interested in dating. For instance, if the guy is really sporty but you couldn't care less about sports, you might be tempted to pretend you're also a big fan. Avoid this. Don't deny your own interests, hobbies, and friends out of fear of judgement or rejection. You can be polite about it (\"Oh, I'm not really into football.\"), and use it as an opportunity to help him learn a little about you (\"I actually really love going to see live music.\").[7]\nIt can be hard to keep this in mind when you are crushing hard, but remember that someone who doesn't like you for who you really are ultimately isn't a good match for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nText him regularly. If you get his number, texting can be a great form of communication that can help you get to know him better. Try to text him once in awhile and see how he responds. This can help you see if he likes you as well. A guy who texts back eagerly is more likely to be interested.[8]\n\nBe yourself when you text. If he asks you questions, give honest answers. Use your own unique voice and sense of humor.\nThrow in an occasional emoji. Don't overdo it, but a few smiley faces now and then can come off as flirty.\nAllow him to initiate texting on occasion. You don't want to overwhelm him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b5/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nTry to flirt some. As you're getting to know a guy, try to do some light flirting. This will convey your interest and allow you to get a sense of whether a guy likes you. If he flirts back, it's likely he's interested.[9]\n\nSmile. Smiling is contagious. Keeping eye-contact while smiling is key. This keeps the tension in the air flirty and fun. A smile to a guy gives him motivation to pursue you. Give him a brief smile and then look away.\nMake eye contact. This will convey interest.\nTry to introduce gentle touch. Lightly brush his arm when you're talking to him, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d4/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nAvoid certain topics. Some topics can tank a conversation, so they should be avoided. If you're trying to get to know a potential romantic interest, stay away from topics that may make him uncomfortable.[10]\n\nAvoid putting yourself down.

Before you ask someone out, it's a good idea to see if they're interested as well. If the guy doesn't seem at all invested, it may be a good idea to stick to being friends.[11]\n\nA guy who's interested will often show this in his body language. He will lean towards you when he talks, make eye contact, and smile frequently.\nPeople often subtly mirror one another's body language when they're interested in someone. A guy may, for example, cross his legs when you do.\nIf a guy makes excuses to touch you, this is a sign of attraction. He may brush your arm, give you a hug, or try to touch you in other ways.\nIt may also help to notice if he acts different around you then he does other people. This may suggest he likes you, and may even go against the normal signs. For instance, if he is usually very flirty with just about everyone but is more quiet and shy around you, this may actually be because he is nervous around you.\nKeep in mind that none of these are definite signs he is interested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-12.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\n Be straightforward. Sometimes, it's best just to be straightforward. It can be scary to confess your feelings; however, if you think the guy is interested, it's easier to just come out and say so instead of beating around the bush.[12]\n\nKeep it simple. Say something like, \"So, I really like you a lot. I was wondering if you feel the same way.\"\nTake a few deep breaths before going into the conversation. This will help you stay calm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-13.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAsk them on a date. If it goes well, ask the guy out on a date. Say something like, \"Do you want to see a movie tonight?\" or, \"Do you want to go to the school dance with me?\" It can be hard to make the first move, but if your feelings are shared that's somewhat easier.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Guy You Like Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/45/Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid12189-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Guy-You-Like-Step-14-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\n Cope with rejection. You can never be 100% sure if someone is interested in you. Even if you think you've read the signs correctly, there's always a chance a guy will not return your affections. If this is the case, try to accept this and move on.[14]\n\nIf the guy turns you down, don't question him or get angry. Say something like, \"Oh ok. I'm disappointed, but I understand.\" Then you can excuse yourself and walk away.\nSeek out support from friends and family members. Find someone to vent your disappointment towards.\nDo something nice for yourself in the wake of disappointment. Buy yourself a new item of clothing or other treat. Take a day off to watch a movie with a friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone","title":"How to Talk to a Girl over the Phone","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nWorking up the Nerve to Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nHave a reason to call. Before you pick up the phone, make sure you know why you’re calling. If you’re phoning a girl you already know, it may be to ask her out. If it’s a girl who you’re hoping to get to know better, it may be to follow up on a conversation that you’ve already had. It’s important to have a concrete reason so you don’t just wind up rambling.[1]\n\nIf you’re not quite ready to ask her out on a date, you might call her up to ask her to hang out in a group with other friends.\nIf you aren’t ready to ask her out and just want to get to know her better, think back to your last in person conversation and find a topic you can revisit. For example, if she recommended a book, you might call to tell her how much you enjoyed it. If you’re in the same class at school, you might ask about a recent project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ea/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nPick a good time to call. When you speak to her, you want to be sure that she’s not in a hurry to get off the phone. Try to call her when she has free time, such as after school or work or during a lunch break.[2]\nIf you’ve just met the girl, don’t wait too long to call her. You want to make sure that you’re still fresh on her mind, so try calling within a day or two of getting her phone number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cd/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSend a text first. If you’re not sure when a good time to call her is, texting first can help. You might ask her if she’s free later that day or tell her that you’ll be calling in a few minutes so she has a heads up.[3]\nIf she texts you for any reason and you happen to be near your phone when the message comes through, take advantage of the opportunity. Send her a text back to tell her that you’re going to call her in a couple of minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/75/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTake a deep breath. If you really like the girl and want the conversation to go well, it’s completely normal to be nervous before you call. To keep yourself from rambling on the phone, try a deep breathing exercise. It can help calm you down so you can make the best impression.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nStarting the Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ab/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGreet her warmly. You want to make a good first impression when she answers the phone, so it’s important to have a solid greeting ready to go. If you know each other fairly well, saying hello and identifying yourself is usually sufficient. If you’ve just met, say hello, give your name, and remind her where she met you.[5]\n\nFor example, if you know the girl well, you might say, “Hey Kristy, it’s John. How are you?”\nIf you’ve just met her, you might say, “Hey Kristy, it’s John. We met yesterday at the library.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTalk about subjects that she's interested in. Talking to her about generic topics like the weather definitely isn’t going to impress her. Tailor the conversation to her interests or hobbies so you know that she’ll be engaged -- and she’ll know that you actually pay attention when she speaks.[6]\n\nFor example, you might say to her, “You mentioned you’re a baseball fan. What did you think about that game last night?”\nYou can also ask her about things that are going on in her life. For example, you might say, “You had a test yesterday, didn’t you? How did it go?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAsk questions that require more than a yes or no answer. You want to keep your conversation going as smoothly as possible, so it’s best to avoid yes or no questions. They tend to stall conversations, while open-ended questions can help it keep going.[7]\nFor example, instead of asking “Did you like the movie?,” you might say, “What were your favorite things about the movie?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nListen to her. You may be tempted to impress her by doing most of the talking over the phone, but that can be a mistake. Give her a chance to speak and listen carefully to what she has to say. That will let her know that her thoughts and opinions genuinely matter to you.[8]\n\nIf she’s telling a story, make sure to let her know that you’re paying attention. When she pauses, you might say “Really?” so she knows you’re following along.\nDon’t be afraid to ask her questions when she’s talking either. That’s another way to let her know that you’re paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0e/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nGet to the point. While it’s good to make small talk with her about her interests and what’s going on in her life, you don’t want to let the conversation ramble on aimlessly. After the initial pleasantries, explain why you called. In most cases, she’ll appreciate your being direct.[9]\n\nFor example, you might say, “I was calling to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow night.\"\nYou can also say something like,“I was calling to see if I could get that pasta sauce recipe we talked about.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nFlirting with Her Over the Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nDeepen your voice. If you’re trying to flirt with her, you want to sound confident and sure of yourself. Lowering your voice a little so it doesn’t sound squeaky or timid can definitely help. Make sure that you speak loudly, though, so she can hear everything you say.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nSpeak clearly and slowly. When you're nervous, you may have a habit of talking quickly. If you want to sound flirty, though, try to slow down your speech and speak clearly. That will help you sound more confident, which is important when you're flirting.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nOffer compliments. When you’re trying to win a girl over, making her feel good about herself can certainly do the trick. Compliment the things that you like about her, but be honest and try not to sound too cheesy.[12]\n\nFor example, you might say, “I meant to tell you the other day… you looked really pretty in that blue dress.”\nDon’t just focus on her physical attributes when you’re complimenting her. If you’re impressed by her sense of humor, intelligence, kindness, or other qualities, make sure to tell her about those too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1d/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKeep the topics light. When you’re trying to be flirty, it’s best to avoid heavy topics, such as your sick friend or the layoffs happening at work. Instead, stick to fun, happy subjects, such as your new cat or the trip you recently took to an amusement park.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 4\n\nEnding the Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/eb/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-14.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTell her you enjoyed talking to her. When you’re getting ready to wind down the call, you want to make sure that she knows you appreciated the time she spent talking to you. Let her know that you enjoyed your conversation and you’d like to talk to her again in the future.\n\nFor example, you might say, “Talking to you was really fun. Let’s do it again.\"\nYou can also say something like, “This was a really great conversation. Maybe we can continue it tomorrow at lunch?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nFinalize any plans. If you called her for a specific reason, be sure to go over the details before ending the conversation. For example, if you asked her on a date and she agreed, make sure you know when you’re going and where you’re going to meet.[14]\nEven if you haven’t made a date or plans, it’s a good idea to mention when you’ll see her again before you end the call. For example, you might say, “I’ll probably see you this weekend at Jake’s birthday party. Let’s talk more then.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-16.jpg/aid651683-v4-728px-Talk-to-a-Girl-over-the-Phone-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nOffer a sincere goodbye. When you’re finished with the conversation, you’ll want to say goodbye. Depending on the time of day, you might end the call by saying, “Have a good night” or “Have a good day.” You can also be more casual and say, “See you later” or “Take care.” Just be sincere so she knows that you mean what you’re saying.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nConversation Help\n\n\n\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Conversation-Topics-for-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png/340px-Conversation-Topics-for-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nConversation Topics for Talking to a Girl on the Phone\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/12/Tips-for-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png/340px-Tips-for-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nTips for Talking to a Girl on the Phone\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Things-to-Avoid-when-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png/340px-Things-to-Avoid-when-Talking-to-a-Girl-on-the-Phone_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nThings to Avoid when Talking to a Girl on the Phone\n\n\n\n"]}]
