You can put out some subtle signals that you're angling for a kiss without coming right out and saying it.  Here's how to communicate it romantically:\n\nGet caught looking (briefly) at the other person's lips.\nDon't purse your lips.  Keep them softly parted — not so much that you could breathe comfortably through the opening, but enough that you could bite your bottom lip easily.\n\nMake your mouth appealing.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over flaky lips, and keep your breath fresh with mints or spray. Avoid gum, which you might have to spit out awkwardly if the other person goes in for a kiss.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Kiss-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBreak the kiss barrier (optional).  If you're feeling brave, test the waters with a small kiss on the hand or the cheek.  If the other person seems interested, it's probably safe to proceed with a kiss on the mouth.\n\n\nIf you're kissing a girl: Take her hand and slowly lift it to your mouth.  Gently press your lips into the back of your hand for 2 or 3 seconds before breaking away.\n\nIf you're kissing a guy: Lean in and plant a 2- or 3-second kiss on his cheek.  Keep your lips soft, and avoid puckering like you would if you were kissing a family member.  If you want your intentions to be extra clear, aim for the part of his cheek just to the side of his lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Kiss-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSet the mood with a romantic compliment.  Go big and pay the other person the sincerest compliment you can think of.  If you get it right, the other person might take the lead and lean in to kiss you.\n\nSay it in an intimate way. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and lock eyes.  Not only does this communicate that you have deep feelings for this person, it entices him or her to come closer to hear you.\nFocus on an alluring quality.  Even if you truly think that your date is an amazing basketball player, now might not be the best time to bring it up.  Instead, base your compliment on how you see your date as a romantic partner.  Try these lines:\n\n\"You are SO beautiful.\"\n\"Your eyes drive me crazy.\"\n\"I love to see you smile.\"\n\"I am so lucky to be with you right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Kiss-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nConsider asking for a kiss directly. If all else fails, go for broke and state your intentions. If your date hasn't picked up on any of your hints and you're dying to lock lips, you might as well be straightforward and just ask if you can kiss him or her.  Don't worry, though — you can be direct while still being romantic and compelling.  Try these phrases if you're at a loss for words:\n\n\"I'd love nothing more than to kiss you right now.\"\n\"I'm sorry if this is too forward, but I'd really like to kiss you.\"\n\"I want to kiss you so much that it is just about killing me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/45/Kiss-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-5-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nGo in for the kiss.  Don't waste any time once you have the go-ahead — close your eyes, lean in and smooch![2]  The next sections will discuss some kissing techniques, as well as how to handle kissing in different dating situations such as a first kiss or kissing after a date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nKissing Techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/77/Kiss-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nKeep your lips soft.  Tense puckers are for family members or people you're obligated to kiss, but keeping your mouth slightly parted and soft communicates a sense of openness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/44/Kiss-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-7-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nDo a few soft kisses.  Start slow with soft, gentle kisses and skip the tongue and the teeth — for now.  If your partner seems receptive, you can move forward to French kissing.\n\nTry to avoid letting your lips smack.  The noise can be distracting, and might break your immersion in the moment.  If you do find yourself smacking, slow down and part your lips a bit more.\nStay light at first.  Avoid smashing your lips against your date's mouth — for now.  Kissing softly and gently gives the other person the chance to stop if it's uncomfortable, as well as allowing you to gauge his or her interest.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Kiss-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-8-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nStay at a manageable level of saliva.  Slobbery puppies are the last thing you want your date thinking of while you kiss him or her.  Avoid this fate by swallowing excess saliva occasionally.  If you notice that your lips are a bit too wet, pull away and discreetly purse them to bring the extra spit back into your mouth.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/06/Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\n\"Lock\" lips.  If your initial kisses have gone well, try a lip lock, which can lead to closer kisses (and is a nice gateway for French kissing). Basically, you'll \"stack\" your lips so that (for instance) it looks like this:\n\nYour lower lip\nYour partner's lower lip\nYour upper lip\nYour partner's upper lip\nAt first, putting your partner's lower lip between yours is the safest bet.  Most people have larger lower lips, making them easier to grab gently with your lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6a/Kiss-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-10-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nMake sure to breathe.  Ideally, you'll be able to breathe softly through your nose while you're kissing.  If that's not possible, though, break away for a second to take a breath.\nDon't feel self-conscious about being out of breath or needing to take a break for a second.  Breathing hard is an indication that you're nervous and excited, which your partner will probably find flattering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Kiss-Step-11-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-11-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nUse your hands. Don't just let your hands hang at your sides like two limp fettuccini noodles — put them to good use![5]\n\nPlace your hands lightly on your partner's shoulders or around his or her waist. (In Western culture, girls generally put their hands on a boys shoulders while he puts his hands around her waist.)\nTake the intimacy up a notch by pulling your partner in closer.\nPut your hands on the sides of his or her face, using your thumb to sweep across the cheekbone, or put one hand under his or her chin and tilt it upward.[6]\n\nAnother seriously sensual move is to put both hands around the back of your partner's head and tangle them in his or her hair, gently pulling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Kiss-Step-12-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-12-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nTest using tongue.  Once you're in a lip lock with your partner's lower lip between both of yours, lightly run the tip of your tongue over it.  If you can move it slowly, even better.\nSee how your partner responds.  If he or she presses in closer or returns the gesture, you're probably clear to keep increasing the intensity of the kiss.  If your date pulls away, maybe it's best to pull back the tongue for now and stick to lips-only kisses.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Kiss-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-13-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nTry French kissing (optional).  Using your tongue during a kiss is, in Western culture, referred to as a French kiss. Why do the French get the credit? Who knows! Here's how to get started:\n\nSweep your tongue along the inside of your partner's lower lip.  Try to move slowly and lightly at first, increasing speed and pressure only if your partner seems to respond well.\nSlide the tip of your tongue inside your partner's mouth and gently move it against the tip of his or her tongue. Use light, darting motions and keep your tongue moving — letting it sit limply in your partner's mouth isn't appealing and will bring a quick end to the kissing.[8]\n\nTry deeper and harder strokes if your partner seems responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/28/Kiss-Step-14-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-14-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n9\n\nMix it up. Don't feel obligated to keep the intensive tongue activity going forever.  Alternate soft and hard, slow and fast, deep and shallow.  You can even go back to using only your lips for a few minutes.\nAlternating your technique will keep your partner from being able to predict what's coming next.  Maintaining this sense of surprise and spontaneity helps your kisses avoid becoming stale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/Kiss-Step-15-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-15-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n10\n\nGently nibble your partner's lips (optional).  Teeth aren't a necessary element of kissing, but a grazing them over your partner's lip can introduce another unexpected element.  Here are some quick pointers:\n\nKeep the pressure as light as possible.  Remember that you're aiming to nibble, not bite.\nMove slowly.  Again, keeping your pace gentle will help prevent accidentally chomping on your partner's lip.\nWhen your lips are locked, place your teeth over your partner's lower lip and slowly pull back until your teeth are almost at the end of the lip.  Pause for a moment, then resume kissing as usual.\nDon't break out the biters too much.  They should be an occasional perk, not the main attraction.\nBe prepared for rejection.  Not everyone likes a side of teeth with their kisses.  If your partner doesn't respond well, try not to be too offended — it's probably a matter of personal taste, not a lapse in your technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/Kiss-Step-16-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-16-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n11\n\nIncrease the intensity with occasional breaks.  Pull away for a moment to look into your partner's eyes, whisper something in his or her ear, or simply catch your breath and marvel at your good fortune.[9]\nInstead of putting a damper on the action, these small moments can actually make kissing more intimate. It gives your partner the sense that you see him or her as a complete person, and not simply something to kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nHaving Your First Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Kiss-Step-17-Version-5.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-17-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTry to pick a trustworthy partner.  Smooching someone you trust can ease a lot of the anxiety of your first kiss.  If you knew you were giving someone his or her first kiss you'd try to be patient and understanding, so expect the same of your partner.\n\nKeep in mind that an awkward first kiss isn't the end of the relationship (or the world).  Actually, it can build intimacy through having a shared experience.  As long as you can laugh it off, you'll be fine.\nRemember, everyone has gone through having their first kiss.  Odds are that most people are more awkward about it than you'll be, even if you don't know it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cb/Kiss-Step-18-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-18-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nPrepare your mouth.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over chapped lips, and brush your teeth and tongue well.  If your mouth feels a little stale, use breath mints or spray to freshen up.[10]\n\nKnowing that your mouth is clean and appealing can help you feel more confident about kissing.\nThat being said, though, don't feel like you need to obsess over cleanliness.  Most mouths just \"taste\" warm, unless you've recently eaten something pungent (like onions or garlic) or you've just woken up in the morning.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8e/Kiss-Step-19-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-19-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nDon’t rush. You only get one first kiss! Unless you’re both so overwhelmed with desire that you have to kiss right now or the world will end, draw it out. It can be tremendously exciting and sensual to tease the kiss before it happens, keeping eye contact the whole time.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 20\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/74/Kiss-Step-20-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-20-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nLet the other person take the lead (optional).  If you're nervous about not knowing the right techniques, let your partner initiate what happens during the kiss.  Imitate what he or she does until you're comfortable trying your own moves.\n\n\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoshe Ratson, MFT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarriage & Family Therapist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoshe Ratson is the Executive Director of spiral2grow Marriage & Family Therapy, a coaching and therapy clinic in New York City.

Moshe Ratson, couples counselor, tells us: \"To show someone you're interested in kissing, try lowering your voice and leaning in slightly while you speak. You can even whisper into their ear.  Get physically closer than normal. Also consider mirroring your partner's body language.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Kiss-Step-21-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-21-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nTake a few calculated risks.  As you become more comfortable with kissing, try to take the lead on initiating kisses or working on new techniques.  If your partner doesn't respond well, simply write it off as personal preference and try something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 4\n\nKissing After a Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 22\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Kiss-Step-22-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-22-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGet close. Since the possibility of a goodbye kiss always beckons—and assuming it’s your desire—it’s best to start getting close sooner than later. Otherwise, you will find yourself saying your goodbyes with what feels like a chasm between you, making the swoop in for the kiss very conspicuous and awkward.\nGuys, this is when you get the dreaded last-minute-turn-and-kiss-on-the-cheek routine, which is second only to the phrase, “You remind me of my brother,” for most-deflating date ending. As you walk your date to the car, the door, etc., put your hand (or a jacket) on your date’s shoulder or back. This breaks the touch barrier, gently lets your date know your intentions, and gives you an excuse to stand very close all at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 23\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/19/Kiss-Step-23-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-23-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nWatch your date’s reaction. If your date angles his or her body away from you or speeds up to create distance, don’t try to complete the goodnight kiss—and don’t let your ego make a fool of you.[13] Simply flash a big smile, thank them for the lovely time, and go about your business. It could simply be that your date isn’t ready to kiss yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 24\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bb/Kiss-Step-24-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-24-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMaintain eye contact. Making eye contact while standing close is a universally acknowledged indicator that a post-date kiss is about to take place.[14]\n\nIf the eye contact becomes too long, break and reestablish it as necessary; it’s better to let your eyes dart around than subject your date to an interrogation-style stare down. One good way to break eye contact while maintaining the romance is to glance down at your date’s lips\nIt may feel awkward to make your desires so clear, just remember that by giving your date a heads-up, you will make the kiss go much more smoothly and improve the odds that it will turn into a glorious make out session. Trying to plant a kiss by surprise, on the other hand, may result in bumped noses and teeth, a startled pullback, and much awkwardness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 25\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b9/Kiss-Step-25-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-25-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nStop the conversation. When people get nervous, they often compensate by finding anything to talk about, killing the kissing opportunities.\n\nWhile you shouldn’t try to end the conversation abruptly, which might come across as trying to get over with your goodbyes, you shouldn’t encourage your date to ramble, either.\nLet the chatter die down by keeping your responses friendly but minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 26\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Kiss-Step-26-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-26-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nConsider breaking the kiss barrier. If everything is going well but you’re not quite ready to dive into full-blown romantic kissing, lean in for a hug and kiss the person on the cheek.\nDon’t confuse this with a friendly peck smack in the middle the cheek; make your feelings clear by placing the kiss close to the ear or mouth and letting your lips linger for a second, or whisper something flirty in their ear with lips touching. This will help the other person know that the kiss isn't meant in a platonic context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 27\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Kiss-Step-27-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-27-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nKeep it simple. If this is a first kiss with this person—or, more importantly still, a first date—don’t overdo it. Keep your lips softly parted and either plant a straightforward kiss on your partner’s lips or up the ante by gently locking lips.\nResist the temptation to kiss hard or with tongue, unless you've been chasing this person for quite some time.  It might seem too forward and shut down future opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 28\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/06/Kiss-Step-28-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-28-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nFollow your date’s lead. Pay attention to how your date responds and moves during the kiss. If they lean closer or linger, you may be able to transition into more romantic kissing; otherwise, end the kiss by pulling slowly back, reopening your eyes to make eye contact, and smiling.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 5\n\nNon-Romantic Kissing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 29\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/99/Kiss-Step-29-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-29-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPucker your lips. Having your lips puckered keeps them tight and somewhat closed, indicating that you're unwilling to open your mouth for more intimacy. Most people will read a pucker as strictly platonic.\nTo know if you're puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible \"pop\" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 30\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Kiss-Step-30-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-30-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake your intentions clear. If you want to kiss someone on the cheek and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in. Try to plant the kiss squarely in the middle of the cheek so that it's not veering for more romantic areas such as the ear or mouth.[16]\nIf you're uncomfortable actually kissing the other person's skin, try air kissing. Lean in so that your cheek is touching the side of the other person's cheek, and kiss the air with a few quick and audible puckers. For extra effect, pull back, switch sides, and do it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 31\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Kiss-Step-31-Version-4.jpg/aid2053-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-31-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nKeep it brief. The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step—nothing more.

You have nothing to prove and nothing to lose. Kissing is a two way street and the guy is probably more nervous than you are.  Take deep breaths, but don't make it too obvious that you're trying to calm yourself down.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMatch the energy of the person you're with. Passionate kissing can be frenzied, calm and meditative, or anywhere in between. There is an unspoken process where both parties will try to match the type of passion the other is aching for.\nIt helps to synchronize breathing rates.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nKeep a conversation. A good way to begin building sexual tension is to keep him talking. Be in a location that is secluded. Having the option to sit is an extra bonus. Just keep a conversation no matter how mundane it feels. The bleaker the conversation the higher your chances are that he's thinking about kissing you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/46/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nUse your eyes. A great way to signal that you're ready to kiss is to go back and forth from looking at his eyes and his lips.  This will create tension that is necessary to have a truly passionate kiss. If he repeats and looks at your lips, he is ready for those kissing sparks to fly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLean close to him.  There are ways of being sly about getting close to him, but you want this move to be obvious. This is another clue for him to know that you want to start kissing.[3]\nIt will help if your bodies are slightly touching. Even if your body contact is ever so slight, it will feel exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/54/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTouch him.

Tilt your head slightly and move close to his face and pause right before you reach his face.  You shouldn't do all the work, but initiating the kiss yourself will excite him.

You do not want to open your mouth too wide or else he might feel strange. Just open it big enough to fit his lip securely between yours.  Show your tongue ever so slightly. Don't fully extend your tongue at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/54/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-9.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nStart slow. Start gently kissing your partner on the lips, don't rush. It is good to build the pace naturally.

Run your fingers through his hair, his beard, or his shirt, and grab onto them.  Pulling him into the heat of the moment is a good way to fire up his passion.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-11.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nUse your tongue. Again kissing is a two way street. You might want to wait, if this is your first time, for him to initiate french kissing. Gently massage his tongue with yours while his tongue is inside your mouth. When you're ready you can try entering into his mouth. Then gently massage his tongue and the roof of his mouth.[6]\nDon't force your tongue into his mouth too quickly. You also don't want to go too deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-12.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nEase the kissing. After you've been french kissing for a while, try moving your head away momentarily. Look at him and smile.

This is another way to enhance the passion. Lightly bite and suckle his neck. Do not do this for too long or else he will get a hickey. If you want to show off a hickey on his neck, then go for it. Feel out the vibes from him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-14.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nBite his lip.  While your kissing, one way to show your passion is to bite his lip.  Don't bite too hard or he might bleed. Only do this if you're confident and think he might like it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nSetting the Mood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-15.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPick the right time. You don't want to start initiating a kiss in a location that isn't opportune.

Passion can't always be planned out in a step by step process. You need to be flexible and able to easily adapt with the mood of your partner.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-17.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe spontaneous. A boy will be into it if you are spontaneous and confident.  If you're going on a walk and see a picturesque trail, then grab his hand and pull him along. Exploring places with someone will increase your security and bond together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Passionately Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-18.jpg/aid1336665-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Passionately-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nPick the right guy.

Naturally you practice good oral hygiene, but if you have any doubts about your breath, take a breath mint shortly before the kiss.  Make sure to finish the mint or gum before you lock lips.[1]\nBe careful, as some mints may leave a bad aftertaste and make your breath worse. Water is the best bet! Leaves you no aftertaste, and freshens your mouth and does not leave you thirsty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a4/Kiss-Passionately-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nApproach the kiss with confidence. Try to kiss their cheek so they turn their head your way. Once you've chosen the right moment to kiss someone, there's no turning back, especially if it's your first time kissing that particular person.  Be decisive and confident.  If the person doesn't want the kiss, he or she will let you know, but until then, act as though you're a pro.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Kiss-Passionately-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSet the mood. If you truly want your kiss to be passionate, you will need to set the right mood. That doesn't mean that you have to throw rose petals everywhere and light a hundred candles, but you should be some place without many distractions--that way you can both focus on each other (and your passionate kiss).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nThe Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/27/Kiss-Passionately-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nLean in and tilt your head slightly.  Leaning in signals that you want to kiss the person, and tilting your head prevents you crushing your nose against the other person's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/79/Kiss-Passionately-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nStart slowly.  Don't try to thrust your tongue into your partner's mouth right away.  Simply press your lips against theirs. Close your eyes as you do to heighten the intimacy and to avoid looking at the pores on your partner's nose. Imagine your eyes are being controlled by a dimmer switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Kiss-Passionately-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nLet yourself linger between kisses. Kiss your partner once, slowly, letting it last for a few seconds. Then slowly draw your lips away, keeping them close enough to your partner's lips so that they are almost touching (but aren't). This lingering will help build the passion, and will really capture your partner's full attention (pfft, as if you didn't have it already).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6d/Kiss-Passionately-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nOpen your lips slightly.  Once the kiss is accepted, try opening your lips slightly. If the other person follows suit, try slightly varying the openness of your lips (both more and less open) throughout the kiss. You may wish to explore the person's lips and tongue a bit with the tip of your tongue. There are no rules; just try to make your motions smooth.\nKeep in mind that there is a thin line between passionate kissing and a drool fest. In order to gauge how wet your kisses should be, kiss the back of your hand like you would if you were kissing your partner and opening your lips slightly. You should leave a slight amount of moisture that dries up in a few seconds. If you see more than this, or leave a big wet circle on your hand, you've overdone it--dial it back.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Kiss-Passionately-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nConsider the French Kiss. As the kiss progresses, you may want to try French kissing, in which you insert your tongue lightly into your partner's mouth and let it dance with your partner's tongue.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nIncreasing the Passion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/Kiss-Passionately-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nBe sensually aggressive. After you've been kissing for awhile, you should try getting a little more adventurous. In between kisses, gently bite your partner's lower lip, letting your teeth graze their lip as you pull away. (Do not suck on their lip or bite too hard, unless they're really into that).[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Kiss-Passionately-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTry some necking.

You seldom, maybe never, see a great kiss in which the participants just let their arms dangle at their sides. At the very least, embrace your partner and gently pull him or her towards you. You can also run your hands through your partner's hair; or caress his or her back, sides, or other parts of the body. Wrapping your arms around your partner can also be a big turn on!\nWhere you put your hands should be determined by the status of your relationship, your desires, and your partner's signals, whether spoken or communicated non-verbally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d0/Kiss-Passionately-Step-12.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTry a ten-second kiss. Some find that a kiss of at least ten seconds in duration will passionately bond two people more than a shorter kiss. Just hold the kiss for longer, regulating your breathing and keeping your eyes closed.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Passionately Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a4/Kiss-Passionately-Step-13.jpg/aid103329-v4-728px-Kiss-Passionately-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nDo not let yourself be distracted by anything. Whether it's fireworks going off behind you (hint: that would be a great moment for a passionate kiss) or people walking by you at the airport (bittersweet, beautiful goodbye or epic reunion?) you should not let yourself become distracted. If you look around while kissing, your partner is probably going to feel a little rejected and the passion-o-meter will definitely drop. No matter what is happening, keep your focus on the kiss and on your partner and let nothing distract you - nothing should fascinate you more than the sensation of kissing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend%2FBoyfriend","title":"How to Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend/Boyfriend","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nGoing for the Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nBrush your teeth.

They may reciprocate with similar kisses across your body.[3]\n\nGive them light, gentle kisses to arouse them and be suggestive.\nAs you do this, pay attention to their overall body language.

As you do this, slightly tilt your head so you can align your lips.\nMaintaining eye contact helps increase the passion and ensure you do not miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nClose your eyes as you are about to touch lips.  When your lips are nearly touching, gently shut your eyes and go for it! Shutting your eyes helps you focus on the feeling of your partner’s lips, so you can enjoy the moment.[4]\nClose your eyes when it feels right, rather than planning for the perfect moment. Do what feels natural when kissing your partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f1/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nGive your partner short, sweet pecks to build anticipation. After you make the initial kiss, go back for 2-3 more kisses in a row. Your partner will likely get the hint that this is not just a simple kiss![5]\nIf your partner tries to French kiss you, you can try pulling back at this point. This will make them want to kiss you even more. As you do this, you can bite your lower lip or wink at them to pull back without breaking the mood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nBuilding the Passion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPull your partner closer. Wrap your arms around them. After you’ve kissed them a few times, use your hands to suggest you want to kiss deeper. You can wrap your arms around their waist and gently pull them toward your chest. In addition, you can place your arms around your their neck so there is no space in between you.[6]\nThis increases the chemistry between you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nVary the pressure and intensity of your kisses. This will increase the passion. As things heat up, open your mouth slightly and touch your tongue to your partner's. Move your tongue up and down slowly and gradually to French kiss them. Use more and less force with your tongue and lips. Changing up the pressure of each kiss will captivate your partner.[7]\n\nDo what feels right in the moment. When it comes to passionate kissing, it’s best to change up the kisses based on what you and your partner are enjoying.\nAvoid being too forceful in your kiss. To determine how much force is appropriate, see what your partner responds well to when you vary the intensity of your kiss.\nLeave a few seconds in between some of your kisses to leave room for your partner to vary their kisses as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMove your hands around your partner’s body to build intensity. While you are making out, caress your boyfriend or girlfriend. You can hold their face in your hands gently, touch the back of their neck, rub their shoulders or back, or place your hands on their thigh.[8]\nThis is a great way to communicate your attraction and affection to your partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nMaking the Kiss Last\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nBe focused as you kiss your partner. To keep the passion going, focus solely on your partner, your kiss, and their touch. If your mind drifts off to other things, bring your attention back to the feeling of their lips on yours or their arm around your back. This way, your concentration is on a juicy, passionate kiss.[9]\nIf you start daydreaming during the makeout session, your partner will likely notice your lack of passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3b/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTry a different types of kisses, to prolong the romance. If you start to lose passion, vary your type of kiss. Keeping things interesting ensures both you and your partner are into the kiss for as long as possible. For instance, if you have been French kissing for a while, go back to sweet, gentle pecks to give your partner a break. Then, try gently nibbling on their lower lip.\n\nYou want to prolong the magic as long as possible to enjoy a long, deep kiss.\nYou can also try twirling your tongue around your partner’s as an alternative to French kissing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nPull your partner back into the kiss, if they pull away. If your partner pulls away, say something flirty like, “I’m not done,” or “I want more kisses.” Do this flirtatiously and gently to be suggestive, rather than pushy. Then, kiss them again![10]\n\nFor an extra sexy touch, try biting your bottom lip as you do this. This is a great way to tease your partner.\nIf your partner seems tired or uncomfortable, they may actually be finished with the make-out session.\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nNote what your partner enjoys throughout the kiss. To prolong the kiss, notice what your partner is most enjoying. For instance, maybe your partner really likes when you use your tongue. Then, continue using these techniques to achieve a long, passionate kiss.\nFor example, if your partner moans slightly or pulls you closer, they are enjoying themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Long Passionate Kiss With Your Girlfriend_Boyfriend Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/45/Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-14.jpg/aid534081-v4-728px-Have-a-Long-Passionate-Kiss-With-Your-Girlfriend_Boyfriend-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAvoid overthinking the kiss. The best kisses are like meditation, where you don’t pay attention to anything else and can get in a state of flow. Don’t think too much about the kissing overall, but instead just do what feels right.[11]\nIf you overthink the kiss, it can feel forced and stiff rather than passionate and sexy.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nEnd the kiss naturally. When you are ready to end the kiss, start kissing your partner softly rather than with much pressure and force. Space out your kisses longer, and go from a French kiss to soft, sweet pecks. You can say, \"Wow, that was great,\" or \"I love you,\" if it feels right.\nYou can remove your lips from theirs and pull them in for a hug, for instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time","title":"How to Kiss a Boy for the First Time","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nBefore the Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/94/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-1-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-1-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nMake sure you have a fresh breath. Fresh breath is important for kissing because you want to give the boy as many excuses as possible to keep on kissing you. Try using lifesavers or mints and always brush your teeth before you meet up with him. Remember, bad breath isn't the end of the world but avoid it if you can.[1]\nTry not to eat strong, spicy, or garlicky food before you see him. Again, if you can't avoid it, it's not a huge deal but it's better to avoid it altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f6/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake sure you're looking good. You can't always plan when and where you'll kiss a boy, but you can try to be prepared. If you're dressed pretty and in a way you feel comfortable, you'll have a spring in your step. That means you will be more confident. More confidence means that there's a bigger chance the boy comes back to kiss you again.[2]\n\nDon't necessarily wear lip-gloss, and don't wear heavy lipstick. Lip-gloss and lipstick, especially, will rub off on your partner, making him look sparkly or sloppy, depending on the situation. Stick with lip balm instead.\nDon't wear a bunch of accessories like hats, or wear your hair so that it gets in the way. Boys like natural beauty anyway. You may want to try kissing the boy when you have your hair up, so that he focuses only on you and the kiss, not the hair tickling his face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nFind a nice place to kiss. Public places are generally not so good for the first kiss, as you can get people staring at you or even heckling you. Try to find a place that's public, but still intimate, for you to share your first kiss.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTry doing something to break the touch jitters away by flirting physically. This will not only make him understand that you like him, but will also give him some time to adjust to you, so that you're not going from 0 to 100 in a second.[4]\n\nHold his hand or put your arms over his shoulders. Start moving your body so that he's much closer to you; it'll be awkward if you have to move a long way to kiss him.\nTouch his hair or face to make him know that you are interested. Gently touch his nose with your pointer finger and smile at him.\nYou can even try hugging him first, and while you're still hugging him, lean back and go in for the kiss. This creates a connection from the very moment you hug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nMake sure that you both are ready for the kiss. This means both physically and emotionally. Kissing says \"I like you more than just a friend,\" and it's sometimes hard to save a friendship after you have a relationship. If you're not sure whether you're doing the right thing, wait until you absolutely know.\nLook at him in the eye. While he's watching you, look slowly towards his lips and back again. If he does the same to you, then he's ready. If he looks a bit uncomfortable and looks away, it's best to leave it for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nDuring the Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/27/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMove your lips towards him slowly, closing your eyes at the last second. You need to be able to see so that you can aim for his lips, but you don't want to keep your eyes open while you kiss, so close them right before your lips lock.[5]\n\nKeep your eyes closed during the whole kiss. When the kiss ends, you can open your eyes and you gently pull away.\nMove into the kiss at an angle. That means if his face is straight up and down, you probably want yours tilted a bit to the left or right — whichever is more comfortable. This helps keep you from bumping noses together when you kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-7-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nUse mostly your lower lip for kissing. Don't pucker up your lips like you've just had a bunch of Sour Patch Kids, or like you're kissing grandma. Keeps your lips loose and try to relax.[6]\n\nGive him one long kiss. You don't have to do anything fancy to get his attention the first time.\nYour big goal is to get him to come back for seconds. Give him just enough so that he's interested, not so much that he's bored. Try to keep the first kiss to under 20 seconds if you can.\nBreathe in and out gently through your nose. Try not to breathe into his throat or onto his lips.\nDon't French kiss on the first kiss. The French kiss is an advanced kiss, so save it for when you really want to blow his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cb/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-8-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nWhile you're kissing, try to go for a gentle open-lip kiss.

No peeking! Your attention should be entirely on his lips and the kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nAfter the Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2e/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-10-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAs you move away from the kiss, open your eyes. Now would be the time to take a look at the boy you've just shared a kiss with. If you did a good job, he'll be flushed, heavy-eyed, and smiling.[7]\n\nSmile back at him. He may be nervous about how he kissed, so you'll probably want to convince him that he did a good job. You can do this by smiling.\nIf you arms are still around him, leave them there for a few seconds before taking them away.

If you went in for the first kiss, maybe you think it's his turn to initiate the next kiss. Be yourself, do what you normally do, but be friendly and encouraging around him. He should try to kiss you again.\nKiss him whenever you want to. Maybe you don't care that much about who kisses whom, as long as there's kissing. That's fine, just make sure that he's into it, too. Kissing him often is likely to lead to a relationship.\nBreak off the kissing. Maybe he wasn't that good of a kisser, or he touched you in the wrong place, or you just get a bad feel from him. That's OK. Try to still be friendly around him, but don't put yourself in situations (i.e. one-on-one, private setting) where he could kiss you again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ac/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/aid407333-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-13-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nRemember kissing etiquette. There are some unspoken rules that you should know about kissing. Pay attention and try to follow them if you can and they make sense to you.\n\nDon't kiss and tell. We know — it's very easy to do. That doesn't mean it's right. What goes on between you and your crush is between you and your crush. Try not to gossip too much about it.\nDon't kiss when you are sick and likely to spread germs. Kissing is a very intimate thing, but that doesn't mean that your kissing partner wants every single part of you, including your cold. Try not to kiss when you are feeling under the weather.\nKiss one person, not everyone. Kissing may be fun, but that doesn't mean that it sends the right message to go out and kiss everyone you want. Focus on one person you really like, try things out, and then move onto someone else if that doesn't work out. You'll be appreciated a lot more, and you'll probably be happier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss","title":"How to Have a Sensual Kiss\n","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nPreparing For the Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/01/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-1.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nGroom yourself. If you're going to be getting up close and personal with your partner, it's a good idea to make your mouth, face, and body appear tantalizing and enticing for them. While everyone may have their own particular grooming routine (your go to mints, that special vanilla scented perfume, that musky cologne), the basics of good grooming include:\n\nBrush your teeth. No one enjoys inhaling the onion and garlic after taste of your lunch or your stale, I just woke up morning breath. [3] So before you approach your partner for a kiss, brush your teeth and have a mint to keep your breath fresh and pleasant.\nWash your face and keep it clean. This is another grooming habit that should not be ignored before enjoying a kiss with your partner. In fact, 53% of women prefer to kiss a clean shaven man.[4] Regardless of if you have whiskers or a clean face, keep it clean and appealing to your partner.\nWear clean clothes.You want to feel confident about experiencing a good, sensual kiss with your partner, so dress the part and make sure you're sporting clean clothes.[5]  Avoid any clothing with spikes, sharp metal, or details that will get in the way of sensual enjoyment.\nApply a little cologne or perfume. Smelling good is a big turn on for both sexes, but especially for women. Studies have shown that above all other physical characteristics, women ranked a man's scent as the most important feature for sexual interest in him.[6] Of course, the key word is \"a little\", as a big turn off can be a partner who reeks of an overpowering cologne or perfume. So apply just a little bit of scent to your body and don't overdo it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c3/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-2.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nCommunicate before you kiss. Don't be shy about telling your partner what you like or asking what your partner prefers in terms of a good kiss. Rather than feel embarrassed about talking about your kissing dos and don'ts, communicating with each other will ensure you both have an enjoyable time. Be sure to discuss your preferences before you go in for a kiss, not during the kiss, so your partner doesn't take your comments as a rebuke.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-3.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSet the mood.

A comfortable, romantic mood will set the stage for a great, sensual kiss.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nHaving a Sensual Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-4.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nEngage in foreplay. Physical interaction like hand-holding or cuddling before you kiss can work as ice breakers and will indicate to your partner that you are interested in some lip action.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/73/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-5.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake eye contact and lean in. As you lean in for a kiss, make sure your partner is also leaning in. Engage in eye contact to ensure you are both consenting to a kiss.\nA good rule is to always close your eyes when you kiss, as your pupils will be dilated and it may appear a bit creepy or weird to your partner if you keep your eyes open.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-6.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTilt your head. About 95% of the time, your partner will tilt their head to the right. If you can't tell which way your partner's head is going to tilt, go right to be safe.[11] Regardless, if your partner is starting to tilt in one direction, go the opposite way so your noses don't collide before your lips do.\nIf you make a miscalculation and tilt the same way as your partner, or miss their mouth completely as your eyes are closed as you lean in, laugh it off and keep going. A certain level of awkwardness can lead to a great, memorable kiss.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-7.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKiss gently and slowly. Studies have shown that women think the biggest mistake men make when they kiss is being too aggressive with their tongues. Men claim that women don't open their mouths wide enough as they kiss.[13] So try to find the sweet spot between an open mouth (not too wide, like you're about to eat a plate of pasta) and a gentle kiss (not a big smack or with too much tongue).[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7b/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-8.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nApply pressure and speed it up a little. Now that your lips are connecting, apply a little pressure to your partner's lips. You can kiss them a bit faster and a bit deeper.\nIf by this point your partner is very responsive to the kiss, you can begin to French kiss, which is just a fancy way of using your tongue as you kiss. Relax your tongue and move it against your partner's tongue in a calm, languid way, like licking an ice cream tongue. Avoid a totally limp or totally stiff tongue, and do not jam or aggressively stick your tongue in your partner's mouth.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-9.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nAdd some variety. One of the most important aspects to creating a sensual kiss is varying where you kiss your partner.[16] Try kissing different parts of your partner's face, paying special attention to the ears and neck. You can bite softly on their lower lip and nibble gently on their earlobe.[17] And if you are sensually kissing a consistent partner, change up where you kiss them so your intimate moments don't feel mechanical or repetitive.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-10.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nPut your body into it. Kissing isn't just limited to your lips, so consider your posture and body position as you kiss. Press your body against your partner's, and use your hands to gently stroke or touch your partner's neck, back, waist, and butt.[19]  Once you have engaged in relaxed, gentle physical moves, you could escalate to straddling your partner, or laying down to face each other as you kiss.\nAs the kiss becomes more sensual, it is important to always listen and tune into your partner.[20] By paying attention to your partner's breathing, body language, and lip movements, you can gauge if they are enjoying the kiss and are ready to escalate further.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Sensual Kiss Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-11.jpg/aid1807847-v4-728px-Have-a-Sensual-Kiss-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nSensually kiss your partner whenever you can. Don't fall off the kissing train, especially once the early stages of your relationship have passed or the honeymoon period fades. Often, people in a long-term relationship stop kissing and lose that intimate, sensual connection.[22]\nThe intensity and emotion of your early kissing can actually become even more passionate as you get to know your partner better, and the communication between you two becomes stronger and more upfront. That old adage can certainly apply to kissing: practice makes perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Kiss-a-Boy","title":"How to Kiss a Boy","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nKissing Him for the First Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Ask a Guy if He Likes You Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Ask-a-Guy-if-He-Likes-You-Step-14.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Ask-a-Guy-if-He-Likes-You-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nWait for a lull in the conversation. Timing a kiss just right can be hard! It's usually best to wait for a natural lull in the conversation to lean in for a snuggle or a kiss. Let the conversation dwindle on its own, but stay close to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8f/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLock eyes with him. Be bold about making eye contact and do it often, especially right before you're about to go in for the kiss. Not only does looking deeply into his eyes feel romantic, but it's easier to make a genuine connection when you're looking into each other's eyes.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ab/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTest the waters by kissing him on the cheek. If you're unsure about how he'll react to a regular kiss on the mouth, you can always give him a kiss on the cheek first. You can give him a quick peck after he says something sweet, or move in slow and prolong the kiss for a few seconds to show him that you're feeling romantic.\nIf he seems shocked or pulls away, you may want to slow things down a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ce/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAsk if you can kiss him if you aren't sure. This might sound awkward, but it can actually be a sweet, cute moment! It also gives him a little warning that it's about to happen, and you'll avoid a blatant rejection if he's not into it.[2]\n\nTry something like, “I've had such a fun day and I'd really like to kiss you right now. Would that be okay?” Or, if you're feeling bolder, you can always go with, \"Wanna make out?”\nBoundaries are really important, so if you aren't sure, just ask.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLean in, close your eyes, and tilt your head to the side. You don't have to close your eyes, but it could be pretty awkward or distracting to stare at him the whole time! It's best to just keep them closed. Also, right before you lock lips, tilt your head to the side a bit.[4]\n\n\nTip: Kissing is easier if one person's mouth is tilted significantly sideways. Plus, it prevents your noses and teeth from bumping!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fe/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTouch your lips to his lightly and softly at first. When you first make contact, lightly graze your lips over his. Try to keep your pressure light and your movements slow and gentle. Keep your mouth closed for now. If it seems like he's enjoying it, you can ramp things up a bit.[5]\nAvoid putting your lips into a tight pucker, which may indicate that you're not that into the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c0/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-14-Version-4.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-14-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nExplore other ways to kiss him. Kisses don't always have to be on the lips! Give your mouths a break and try kissing him on the earlobe, under the jawbone, or on the inside of his wrist. If you want to take it up a notch, try kissing him in the little hollow place near his collarbone.[6]\n\nYou can also catch your breath by giving him sweet pecks on the nose or forehead.\nDon't try to rush things! Move at a pace that's comfortable for both of you.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nMaking out with Your Guy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c9/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTry tongue-kissing if it's clear he wants to take things up a notch. Open your mouth slightly and part your lips enough that you could comfortably get your tongue through them. Lightly run your tongue over his lower lip, then pull your tongue back.[8]\n\n\nTip: Keep the pressure light and the movements gentle. Remember, you can always go harder and faster later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/51/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-16.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nUse your tongue sparingly. Slowly and softly dart your tongue in and out of his mouth, pulling back for a few moments each time. For example, you can touch his tongue with yours, then pull back. Circle your tongue around his, then pull back. If you don't pull back occasionally, the kiss might feel aggressive and drool will definitely become an issue![9]\nPulling back also gives a chance to catch your breath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-17.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAvoid biting or giving him a hickey. A light nibble on his lower lip might be okay every now and then, but definitely avoid biting him or getting your teeth involved in any other way. Gentle kisses on the jaw are great, but don't suction your mouth to his neck like a vacuum hose. Most people just aren't into hickeys![10]\nPlus, leaving behind visible traces of your make out session could get you both in hot water with your parents. Keep it low-key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-18.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nExplain your preferences to him in a gentle way. If his kisses are more aggressive or faster than you'd like, don't suffer in silence! Pull back and whisper something like, \"I like being kissed like this.\" Then, demonstrate exactly what you like. He'll appreciate the direction![11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-19.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-19.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nPut your hands to good use while you're kissing. Don't just let your hands sit there limply⁠—use them to make the kiss better! Pull him closer and try resting your hands on his shoulders, hips, chest, or the sides of his face.[12]\n\nYou could also try tangling your fingers in his hair.\nIf he seems uncomfortable with any of your touches, reel it in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 20\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-20.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-20.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nExperiment with different techniques to keep things interesting. As you get more comfortable, you can make the pressure more insistent or the kisses faster. You can also try changing up the intensity and speed. Avoid settling into one technique for too long![13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/49/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-21.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nLeave him wanting more. Ending the kiss before it gets boring is always ideal. If you stop while it's still fun, he'll instantly be looking forward to next time! Pull back, look into his eyes, and smile before you part ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nFlirting and Creating a Romantic Vibe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/93/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nSay \"hi\" when you see him and strike up a conversation. Instead of just awkwardly asking how it's going, try to have a more specific opening prepared to get the conversation flowing. Tell him what you're up to, ask about his plans for an upcoming event, or bring up an inside joke. Be sure to ask him open-ended questions that require more than a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nFor example, you might say, \"I heard you're going to the Winter Formal with a group of your friends. Fun! What are you planning to wear?\"\nYou could also say something like, \"I totally spaced when the homework assignment was announced in History. Can you help me out?\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nFind excuses to touch him in small, fleeting ways. Light touches can help you gain the confidence to break the touch barrier in a more romantic way. For example, when you're talking to him, gently touch him on the arm when he says something funny, or \"accidentally\" bump into him when you're walking together.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nPay him a genuine compliment. Everyone likes to be complimented, and it will also communicate that you're thinking of him. Focus on a quality you genuinely like about him⁠—whether it's his eyes, his sense of humor, his hair, and so on⁠—and tell him why you appreciate it.[16]\n\n\nTip: A nice compliment doesn't have to be complicated! Try something like, \"Has anyone ever told you that your hair looks amazing that way?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKeep your body language positive and open. How you carry yourself can tell him a lot about how you feel! Plus, it will probably be a lot easier to move in for a kiss and, when you do, he won't be as surprised. Don't cross your arms, twiddle your thumbs, or clasp your hands together. Instead, orient your body toward him.\n\nFor example, if you're standing, keep your toes pointed at him. If you're sitting, point your knees.\nIf you can't help fidgeting, put your hands behind your back so that you look open from the front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/55/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nFind a good opportunity to be alone with him. You don't have to be totally alone, but a little privacy is ideal. For example, if you're hanging out with a group, go outside to grab some fresh air with him. If you're hanging out in public, try to find a quiet area that feels intimate. For instance, if you're at the mall, you could sit on a bench in a low-traffic area.[17]\n\nYou could also try offering to walk home with him or dropping by his house to ask if he'd like to go out for a bit.\nIf you really want to make sure you're alone, you can always ask him out on a solo date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c9/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-6-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nSit or stand a little closer to him. Kissing him will feel more natural if you gradually move a little closer to him. It will also subtly alert him that you want to be intimate, which is always better than swooping in suddenly and completely catching him off guard.[18]\n\nIf you're sitting together on a couch or in a car, move in closer than you need to. If you're standing up, inch a little closer to him or visibly shiver to see if he pulls you close.\nYou can also try holding his hand or leaning on his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ce/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid3895-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nGo in for a hug or snuggle to initiate a romantic moment.

Draw out the moment after your compliment. Shoot a brief glance at his lips, not longer than two seconds, and then make eye contact with him.

He may even make the first move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Your Boyfriend for the First Time Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid794261-v4-728px-Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLean in for the kiss, gently pressing your lips against his. Your boyfriend may take the lead with the kiss, or he may turn away. If he does shy away, don’t force him to kiss. Respect him and understand that he may not be ready.[4]\nIf you’re feeling unsure about whether your boyfriend wants to kiss, lean in for the kiss slowly. This gives him time to stop the kiss if he doesn’t want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nUsing Touch and Body Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Your Boyfriend for the First Time Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-7.jpg/aid794261-v4-728px-Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMirror his body language. Notice your boyfriend’s body language. Then, subtly use your body to mirror his posture, arm position, or leg crossing. Mirroring body language like this can help you bond with him. Your boyfriend may feel closer to you without even realizing it.[5]\nMirroring body language also builds empathy between you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Your Boyfriend for the First Time Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-8.jpg/aid794261-v4-728px-Kiss-Your-Boyfriend-for-the-First-Time-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nHold his hand.

To see if a girl is interested in kissing you, give her compliments to send the message that you like her. Casually say something nice about her hair, outfit, or style. Include compliments about her personality or intellect so that you don’t come off as materialistic.[1]\n\nSay, “I really like the way that outfit matches your eyes,” or, “You have the cutest haircut.”\nInclude compliments about her personality. For example, “I love your laugh,” and “You’re so smart,” are excellent, simple compliments that you can use.\nTry to compliment things that relate to her specifically. Saying that she lives in a nice house, for example, isn’t going to get you anywhere.\nTry to compliment a girl when you’re spending time with her alone. If you’re with a group of people, they may poke fun at you for trying to flirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake eye contact and smile at her. When you lock eyes with her, don’t divert your gaze like you’re ashamed or scared of her. Instead, keep your eyes on her and crack a slight smile without showing your teeth. Making eye contact and smiling are two of the easiest ways to send subtle messages that you’re interested in someone.[2]\n\nIf it turns out she doesn’t like you back, you can always play it off like the eye contact and smiling were simply you being nice.\nMaking eye contact is a sign of confidence.\nDon’t stare for more than 4-5 seconds. Aggressive staring can come off as creepy if you do it for too long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nRead her body language to see how she responds to flirting. If she smiles back, maintains eye contact, or blushes and turns away while smiling, she’s probably interested in you. If she furrows her eyebrows, turns away without smiling, or simply doesn’t respond, she probably doesn’t want to kiss. Pay attention to her body language—especially in the moments leading up to a potential smooch.[3]\n\n\nTip: If she is carrying a purse or backpack, pay attention to how she holds or carries it. If she holds firmly on to it while talking to you, it could be a sign that she’s a little scared or nervous and doesn’t really feel comfortable around you yet. Consider leaving her alone and trying to strike up a conversation later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/78/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTest the waters by holding her hand or wrapping your arm around her. When you’re alone with her, try casually brushing your hand against hers to see how she responds. If her fingers open up, try holding her hand. If hand holding seems like too much, lean up against her while you’re walking. If she doesn’t shy away, try throwing your arm around her.[4]\n\nIf she cuddles her way under your arm or holds your hand, continue walking for a little so that you don’t seem too eager.\nAnother common way to test the mood is to try and brush her hair back. While this move certainly looks good in the movies, it can be kind of risky. She may think you’re reaching for her face and turn away.\nHand holding is a more concrete sign she is ready for a kiss than the shoulder move is, but trying to wrap your arm around her requires less of a risk. Choose a move based on how confident you feel.\n\n\n\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConnell Barrett\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDating Coach\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConnell Barrett is a Relationship Expert and the Founder and Executive Coach of Dating Transformation, his own relationship consulting business founded in 2017 and based out of New York City.

For instance, you might notice that the other person is making deep eye contact with you, they're leaning close to you, and their body language matches yours. When that moment comes up, it's probably a good time for a kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nGet consent by asking if you can kiss her. Don’t steal a kiss. Instead, ask if you can kiss her. You can be incredibly direct and simply say, “Can I kiss you?” You can also opt for a more romantic tone and say something like, “I’d love nothing more than to kiss you right now,” or, “You’re so beautiful. I could kiss you right now.”[5]\n\nIf she kisses you first, don’t stop her to ask for her consent. You already have it.\nThrow in a breath mint or a piece of gum a few minutes before asking her to kiss you to ensure that your breath isn’t nasty.\nOnce you have consent, don’t waste your time.

If you were holding her hand or already had your arm around her, leave it there as you turn to face her. If you weren’t holding her, quickly check to see where her hands are. if she’s got them in front of her, reach out to hold her hands. If they’re at her side, wrap your arms around her waist so that you’re hugging her.[6]\n\nIf you’re not comfortable holding her hand or wrapping your arms around her, consider putting your hands on her shoulders. This is a good middle ground between a full embrace and standing still.\nUnless it’s a playful, quick smooch, don’t put your arms down to your sides. It will make you seem like you’re not emotionally invested in the kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d3/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nRelax your lips and don’t “pucker up.” There’s nothing cute about pushing your lips out and pursing them together. Keep your lips flexible as you’re initiating a kiss by keeping your facial muscles relaxed. Nobody wants to kiss stiff, hard lips.[7]\n\nKeep your mouth closed. You kiss with lips, not teeth!\n\nTip: It’s okay to pucker your lips together for a quick kiss on a cheek, but avoid doing this when you’re kissing a girl on the lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nLean in closer and turn your head a little. As you lean in for the kiss, pay attention to how the girl is angling her head. Tilt your head in the opposite direction to prevent squishing into her nose as you kiss her. Keep your head slanted so that your nose will brush right against her cheek.[8]\n\nAvoid jerking movements and try to be smooth as you do this. It should be a subtle, simple motion.\nLean in with your whole body. Don’t stick your head out like you’re scared of her!\nDon’t turn your head so far that your lips are going to make a cross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nLocking Lips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled French Kiss Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/French-Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-French-Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nClose your eyes just as you’re about to make contact with her lips. Once you’re 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) away from her lips, begin to slowly close your eyes. Closing your eyes while kissing is a sign that you’re comfortable with surrendering to the moment. Keep them closed throughout the duration of the kiss.[9]\n\nKeeping your eyes open while kissing is a bad idea. It can look kind of creepy and is considered to be a beginner mistake.\nSmile a little as you’re leaning in to let her know that you’re happy about kissing her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/06/Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-Step-9-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nHold your lips to hers for 1-4 seconds. Press your lips into her lips without pushing her or shoving your nose into her face. Apply light pressure and embrace her by pulling her closer. Kiss her for 1-4 seconds before moving back with your lips still on hers to give her a moment to catch her breath or adjust her position. Keep your lips soft as you kiss. Relax your facial muscles and don’t push your lips out as you make contact with her lips.[10]\n\nTo pull her closer, try moving your hands around her back and leaning into her.\nDon’t shove your tongue down her throat. Keep your tongue behind your teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/47/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-17-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nRelease your lips for a second and read her body language before kissing her again. Once you’ve leaned back a little bit, check her body language. If she’s starting to pull away, it is a sign that she is done kissing for now. If she leans in further, it is a sign that she is comfortable and you can continue to kiss her.[11]\n\n\nTip: If she’s done kissing for now, don’t pressure her into continuing to kiss. Instead, play it off by smiling at her and continuing to talk about whatever you were discussing before the kiss. This will make the kiss feel natural and make you seem confident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAlternate the side that your head is on after multiple kisses. After 20-30 seconds of kissing, switch the angle that you’re kissing her from. If your nose is resting on her right cheek, lean back for a second and swap it to the right. This will add a little variation and give her neck a break from leaning in one direction for too long. \nYou don’t have to switch sides if you don’t want to, but your neck will get sore after a minute or so, especially if she’s shorter than you and you have to lean down to kiss her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 4\n\nUsing Different Styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/be/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGive her a quick peck on the cheek as a simple sign of affection.

Lean into her cheek and give her a quick kiss to show some affection.\nAlways get consent first, even for a simple peck on the cheek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss in Public Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0c/Kiss-in-Public-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-in-Public-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLift her off of the ground as you kiss her to be more romantic. While kissing her, if you’re confident that you can lift her off of the ground, wrap your arms around her waist and lift her up while keeping your lips against her. This is a classic romantic gesture and will show her that you’re really attracted to her and enjoying the kiss.[12]\nIf she resists in any way, don’t try to keep lifting her up. Some girls don’t like being lifted off of the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Girl Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Kiss-a-Girl-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid12791-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Girl-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTry French kissing after you’re comfortable with one another. Once you’ve gotten used to kissing one another, you can start to make out. While kissing, run the very tip of your tongue over her lower lip a few times. If she opens her mouth a bit more, then she may be interested. Introduce your tongue slowly and once your tongues are touching, move your tongue slowly around her mouth.[13]\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the French kissing if you have a lot of saliva built up in your mouth.\nTake breaks! It can be hard to breathe if you’re mouths are locked in a French kiss for more than 10-20 seconds.\n\n\nTip: Don’t shove your tongue down her throat without warning. This is a terrible idea and will freak her out.\n\n\n\n\n\n"]}]
