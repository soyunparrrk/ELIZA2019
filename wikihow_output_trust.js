Putting yourself out there is tough, but it is much easier to build trusting relationships if you are willing to take the first step. Try something small, like sharing a personal story, confiding a small anxiety, or asking someone to go on a date. If the person is rude or distant, then you can move on to someone else. But if they offer something back or sympathize with you, telling a similar story or agreeing to go on a date, then you’ve both taken the first step towards a trusting relationship.[1]\n\nRemeber to always be honest when you're trying to build trust. Even little lies can lead to large amounts of distrust later on.\nShare, but don't overshare. This can be intimidating at the beginning of any relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Trust-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBuild trust over time. Trust is not a switch that you can switch on or off. Rather, it's built up over time, growing alongside your relationship. Begin trusting people with little things – getting to a meeting on time, helping with small errands – before trusting someone with big secrets.\nThere is no need to force a judgment on someone right when you meet them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/61/Trust-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nConfide in people slowly. Baring your secrets, fears, and insecurities requires a lot of trust. Sharing your emotions with someone often takes place later in a relationship, after you have already built up trust. Start confiding in someone slowly, seeing how they respond, before fully committing to trust them. Whenever you share stories with someone, ask yourself a few questions:\n\nDo they seem interested in what I have to say? Trust requires that both parties care about each other.\nAre they willing to share stories about themselves? Trust is a give and take, where both parties feel comfortable sharing.\nAre they dismissive, condescending, or oblivious to my worries and concerns? Trust requires respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Trust-Step-4.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nHave different levels of trust for different people. There is no set “level” of trust that you need with people. There are going to be some people who you trust a little, like coworkers or new acquaintances, and some people you would trust with your life. Instead of putting people into two categories, “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy,” look at trust as a spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Trust-Step-5.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nObserve a person’s actions and behaviors, not their words. It is easy to make a promise but hard to keep one. You should watch people’s actions to see if they are trustworthy, not follow their words. If you ask them for a favor, reserve your judgment until the job ends. By observing actions and not words you can view someone’s trust objectively, building trust based on facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Trust-Step-6.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nBe a trustworthy person in return. If you want to build trust with someone, you need to be trustworthy yourself. If you are constantly breaking promises, telling secrets, or showing up late, you will find that people do the same thing to you. Think about other people's needs. Offer your help and guidance, and listen to them when they talk to build a trusting relationship.\n\nNever share someone’s secrets with other people unless they are in need of help. For example, a depressed friend may confide in you that they have suicidal thoughts, but you should share this with a counselor or professional even if they ask you not to tell.\nKeep your promises, and don’t cancel plans once you’ve made them. That also means not making a promise unless you truly believe you will be able to keep it.\nIf someone asks you for a promise that you know you can't keep, let them know that you take promises very seriously and you can't guarantee the outcome they are requesting but that you will still try your best to follow through on the action.\nBe honest, even in difficult situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f6/Trust-Step-7.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nRemember that no one is perfect. Unfortunately, people are always going to make mistakes – skipping a meeting, letting a secret slip, or acting selfishly. If you expect every person to “earn your trust” they will all fall short from time to time. Trusting someone is about seeing through a person’s occasional faults at the bigger picture.[2]\nWhen people make the same mistake time after time, or refuse to apologize for problems, they become untrustworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Trust-Step-8.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nTrust yourself. If you believe someone is trustworthy, then go with your instincts. Likewise, if you have a gut feeling that they're untrustworthy, listen to that. Having faith in yourself not only makes it easier to build trust, it makes it easier to move on when someone breaks your trust. Know that you are emotionally stable and happy. This helps you feel comfortable taking a risk trusting other people.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nFinding Trustworthy People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Trust-Step-9.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nKnow that trustworthy people are reliable and on-time. Someone you trust values your time and opinion, and won’t put their interests first all the time. Being late to meetings, dates, or events with you is a sign that they may not be fully trustworthy.\nApply this concept within reason – everyone is late from time to time. The bigger issue is with people who are never on time or  constantly cancel or change plans with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Trust-Step-10.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nKnow that trustworthy people follow through on their words. There is often a big difference between what some people say and what they do, but trustworthy people practice what they preach. To trust someone you have to know that they will do the things they say they will. Trustworthy people, for example:\n\nKeep promises they have made.\nFinish jobs, chores, or errands they commit to doing.\nFollow through on plans made together.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2c/Trust-Step-11.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nKnow that trustworthy people don’t lie. Liars are some of the most difficult people in the world to trust because you can never know what they are actually thinking about. If you catch someone making lies, even small ones, it is a major red-flag that they are not trustworthy. Make a mental note of any large exaggerations and white lies. If they happen every time you see someone, they are more likely than not untrustworthy.\n\nLiars often fidget, have trouble looking you in the eye, and change the details of stories frequently.[5]\n\nThis includes “lies by omission,” when people hide information from you to avoid tension or anger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c0/Trust-Step-12.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKnow that trustworthy people will trust you back. More often than not, a trustworthy friend is willing to confide in you as well. They know that having trust is a two-way street, and you must feel comfortable sharing things if you want people to share back. When someone trusts you it is a signal that they value your friendship and opinion, making them less likely to do things that would damage your relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ab/Trust-Step-13.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nNote how someone talks about other people. If someone constantly tells you secrets or says things like, “Benny asked me not to say this, but...” then they will likely do the same with your secrets. The way people act around your is indicative of how they act when you are not around. If you think that other people shouldn’t trust this person, you probably shouldn’t trust them either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nRepairing Trust after Trauma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Trust-Step-14.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nKnow that it is normal to have trust issues after trauma. After difficult events, most people will become defensive and have a hard time trusting people. This is a survival instinct – trusting someone leaves you vulnerable for future pain. Thus, avoiding trust can protect you from harm.[6] Don’t blame yourself for having trust issues. Rather, acknowledge the pain and try to learn from the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Trust-Step-15.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nRemember that one person’s actions are not reflective of everyone. There are negative, mean, and untrustworthy people in the world. Most people, however, are kind and trusting, so don’t let one bad experience or person destroy your ability to trust again. Always remind yourself that there are good people around, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/27/Trust-Step-16.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nSlow down your judgment. Oftentimes, when we're hurt, angry, or upset, we react emotionally and make the situation worse. Before deciding that you no longer trust someone, take a few minutes to ask yourself rational questions:\n\nWhat facts do I know about the incident?\nWhat am I guessing or assuming about this person?\nHow did I behave in this situation? Was I trustworthy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Trust-Step-17.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKnow that people remember betrayal more than positive interactions. According to a Cornell University study,[7] our brains are hardwired to remember betrayal faster than good memories, even if the betrayal is small. Remember your positive interactions with someone as you rebuild trust. There are likely more good memories then you immediately remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/eb/Trust-Step-18.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLook for sincere, meaningful apologies. People make mistakes, even people you thought you could trust. What matters most after an argument or incident is how the person responds. Quick or curt apologies often show that the person is not really apologizing. Usually, they simply want you to stop being angry at them. Truly sincere apologies are ones that you do not demand, when someone looks you in the eyes and asks for forgiveness. A sincere apology is the first step to rebuilding trust.\nOffer your own apologies for wrongdoing when applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Trust-Step-19.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-19.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nAdjust your expectations. Just because someone has lost your trust doesn’t mean they are entirely untrustworthy. Instead of returning back to where you started, try trusting someone with smaller, more manageable things. When a friend tells secrets behind your back, you may not confide in them again. That doesn’t mean, however, that you cannot still hang out, work on projects, or talk with each other.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 20\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Trust-Step-20.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-20.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nKnow that you may never fully trust someone who has hurt you. Unfortunately, though you can rebuild a lot of trust with someone, there are times when the wounds are too deep to be forgiven. If someone has proven to you that they are not trustworthy don't  feel bad for cutting them out of your life. You cannot open yourself up to be hurt or abused again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Trust Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a9/Trust-Step-21.jpg/aid400278-v4-700px-Trust-Step-21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nMake a counseling appointment if you still have severe trust issues. Major trauma has a lasting impact on the brain, and you should consider seeing a professional if you cannot build trust with people. A symptom of PTSD is an inability to trust. If you do not want to see a therapist, try out a support group in your area first.\nRemember that you are not alone with your issues – there are other people like you who are also struggling with trauma.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ATrust","title":"Category: Trust\n","content":[]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ARestoring-Trust","title":"Category: Restoring Trust\n","content":[]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Regain-Trust-in-Someone","title":"How to Regain Trust in Someone","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nHelping Out Yourself First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nTake some time away from the other person, if you haven't already. In order to regain trust in someone else, you need to heal. Quite possibly, this other person hurt you dearly. You'll want to grow from this situation by turning lemons into lemonade, but to do so, you should take a little time for yourself.[1]\n\nIn the heat of the moment, your emotions can cloud your judgment. That means that it's hard to think straight, and you could end up saying things that aren't exactly helpful in fixing the situation. How you feel is very important, and it's a big part of regaining trust, but it's also not productive if you don't step away for a little bit.\nIt's going to be hard not to think about what happened, but try to.[2]  At least for a little while. Do something so engaging that you become completely enthralled in the now — go away to a cabin by the lake with your friends, go rock climbing and sweat a little, or have a great conversation with a total stranger. For the time being, forget what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/18/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nDon't make yourself into a victim. You are a victim of the circumstances, but don't become the victim. Do you see the difference? The victim of circumstance understands that the betrayal of trust was one incident, while the victim feels like the entire relationship — all the good along with the bad — is now affected. The victim of circumstance wants to get over the incident; the victim wants to wallow in the pain that the other person caused them. Staying the victim sets up a big roadblock to regaining trust in someone.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/40/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nRemind yourself that not all is lost. Especially after a betrayal in a relationship, it's easy to feel like the world is being turned upside down and you're in a free fall, disconnected from everything you thought you knew. It's a very disheartening feeling. But it's not the truth.  There's still plenty of brightness in your life if you know where to look. Reminding yourself of this simple notion can do a lot to help rebuild trust.[4]\n\nTake a look at the simplest things in life that you still have. Your friends, family, and health are three profound things that you most likely still have, even if the person who betrayed you feels connected to each one of those things. Fall in love again with just how lucky you are to have these things.\nTry to look at the positive side of things. It may seem funny to think of a betrayal as having positive aspects, but it's certainly possible. Here's the big one: You've learned a lot about the other person as well as about yourself. If you choose to continue the relationship, you'll want to use these teachings to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b8/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDon't do anything rash without thinking about it first. When someone we care about deeply betrays us and misplaces our trust, one of our gut reactions is to try to punish them for hurting us. If our boyfriend cheats on us, we go out and get cozy with that guy we once had a thing for; if our friend lies to us, we justify lying back to them. Try not to do anything crazy before thinking about it first. Here's how you might go about it in your head:\nAsk yourself: Are you doing this for yourself or in order to hurt the other person? If you're doing this for yourself, then go ahead — you earned it. But if you're doing something in order to hurt the person who hurt you, ditch the need to \"get back at\" the other person. When you try to put back together the pieces of your relationship, these actions will only stand in the way of making everything good again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBe social. After taking a little time for yourself to sort through things, get social again. There's nothing quite like social contact to remind you that the world goes on. And while no one is forcing you to move on with your life quite yet, it's a good idea to get some perspective on things. Perspective helps. Friends, colleagues, and even total strangers will help you get that.\nListen to your friends, but take anything they say with a grain of salt. They're probably somewhat disconnected from what happened, and they have a natural tendency to want to comfort you. (That's part of what they're there for.) Just don't take for granted that they know everything that's going on, or that they know what's best for your relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nTaking Stock of What's Left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/24/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nStart by evaluating the relationship. While it’s sad to see any relationship go — whether it's a friend or lover — sometimes the betrayal is a wake up call and a sign that there are many fish in the sea. Looking at the relationship as a whole should help you decide whether you want to regain trust in the person or whether you'll probably want to move on.\n\nWhat was the relationship like before the incident? Did you have fun and laugh frequently? Or did you feel like it was a constant chore and you were doing most, if not all, of the work.\nDid you feel listened to? Was your word as important as theirs? Were lines of communication free and open, or closed and constrained?\nDid you feel that you could rely on this person?\nWas the relationship balanced or was it one-sided and not in your favor?\nWas the betrayal out of character or, in retrospect, might you have seen this coming? Does the person have a history of breaking the trust of their friends or lovers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nExamine why you were in the relationship. This is another important exercise in self-discovery you should try to complete before you decide to allow yourself to trust the person who betrayed you. After all, if you're looking for the right things in the wrong places, you might do better to ditch this person and find someone else. It's hard to say, but it's tough medicine.\n\nAre you in a relationship because you need someone to complete you? This may be a problem. Asking someone to complete you is an impossible task. Only you can do that. If you're in a relationship because you need one in order to feel \"whole\", you should probably consider taking a break from dating.\nAre you asking for people to hurt you? Do you always date the same kind of person — the person who ends up hurting you in a fiery, dramatic spectacle? You might subconsciously be asking to be hurt because you don't think you deserve better. Well, you do. Improve your self esteem and don't settle for the kind of person you know will hurt you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a4/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGrade your relationship. Sure, grading someone sounds callous, but it is an effective and honest way to assess whether or not this person meets your needs. Besides, we deserve five-star relationships, so make sure that's what you've got.\n\nIdentify three to five things you value most in a relationship. For some people laughter and emotional support will be among their top needs. For others, intellectual stimulation is a top priority.\nUsing your grading system, determine whether or not this person is meeting your needs and is compatible with your values. For example, if the person shares all your values and did an excellent job of meeting your needs except for the betrayal, it might be a good idea to give them a second chance. On the other hand, if the person doesn't really share any of your values but is an overall good person, the betrayal might mean it's time to move on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nExamine the betrayal itself.  Indeed, some people are not deserving of your trust. But sometimes, a mistake hurts because it reminds us of previous a wound. A betrayal that is calculated or born of malicious intent is a clear indication that this person is no one you can trust. But mistakes that are accidental and out of character may deserve forgiveness.  Consider the following:\n\nWas it a calculated deceit, for example a cheating spouse, malicious gossip or sabotage by a co-worker?\nWas it accidental, like crashing your car or spilling the beans on a secret?\nWas it a one-time slip, or does the incident represent a long-standing pattern of behavior?\nConsider the circumstances: Is your friend or loved one going through a particularly trying time and could this have played a part in the injury?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/32/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-10.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nMeasure the severity of the betrayal. Was it mild, moderate or severe? The severity of the betrayal is often going to be a good sign of the degree of pain the other person put you through.\n\n\nMild offenses include blurting a secret, telling 'white' lies (lies that are told to spare your feelings, as opposed to lies told to deceive you) and complimenting your romantic partner in a way that may have seemed flirtatious. These tend to be accidental and one-time incidents. Generally, if you express your concerns, they are met with an immediate and sincere apology and a promise to be more mindful of your feelings in the future.\n\nModerate offenses include gossiping about you, regularly borrowing money but rarely repaying you and regular disrespect. These behaviors reflect a lack of consideration and selfishness. It can be difficult to confront someone who seems indifferent to your feelings, but sometimes people are just oblivious. These flawed behaviors can be sometimes be talked through and resolved.\n\nSevere betrayals include stealing a significant amount of money, infidelity, spreading malicious gossip or lies, and sabotaging you at work or in some other endeavor. These are calculated betrayals, the perpetrator is aware of the grief he or she will cause and does it anyway. In such cases, you may need to seek professional guidance to salvage the relationship, if indeed you decide to forgive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nSlowly Rebuilding Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-11.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nFocus on all the positives of the relationship. If you’ve decided to forgive and move forward, one of the best ways to let go of resentment, anger and suspicion is to remind yourself of all of the wonderful things this person brings to your life. There's probably a reason — hopefully a lot of reasons — why you stayed in the relationship. Think about those as you begin to let the other person in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fb/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-12.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTry putting yourself in their shoes. It's hard to do, and it's not necessarily expected of you, but it will help save the relationship if that's what you want to do. Try to imagine what drove the person to betray you, indirectly or directly. Try to think about how the person feels at this very moment. You shouldn't make any decisions just because you pity someone, but showing empathy is an olive branch that will mean a lot to the other person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-13.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTalk about the incident. Be clear about your feelings, and give the other person a chance to speak. At the same time, know that asking for specific details can make the pain even worse.[5] This can make the healing process even harder.\n\nDiscuss the event. Explain how you interpreted the event and why you were hurt. Avoid accusatory language. Give the other person the opportunity to explain the situation from their perspective.\nEstablish your expectations and ask what is expected of you. This will help clarify the cause of the current problem, as well as avoid future disagreements.\nDon't expect to get through talking about the incident in one sitting. Make that clear to your friend or partner. The healing process is going to take some time, and that person should be prepared to talk about it for some time. If they're not prepared to, that's a sign that they may not care as much about mending the relationship as you do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-14.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDepersonalize the incident. Often, hurtful behavior has much more to do with the other person than it does with us. Rather than face their own issues, people project them onto a close friend, family member or partner. If the incident was borne of the other person’s insecurity, help him or her deal with the pain. This will help you view the incident with compassion and help you to forgive. Here are a few examples of hurtful behaviors that are not personal attacks:\n\nSomeone makes a snide comment about your appearance because he or she feels unattractive.\nA partner flirts to feel desirable, not because you are unloving or unlovable.\nA friend is hyper-competitive because she feels inadequate.\nYou are sabotaged by a co-worker because he fears his work is inadequate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/20/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-15.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nTry to keep a positive outlook on things. If you fear the relationship or friendship just isn't going to work, but want to try anyway, you may as well throw in the towel right now. If you decide to give it another try, believe that it will work, not because you want it to, but because the other person has earned it.\nDon't constantly live in fear of the same betrayal happening again. Try to get back to normal as much as possible. If you find yourself living in the constant shadow of the betrayal, that's a sign that it's time to get out — both for your sake and for the other person's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Regain Trust in Someone Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-16.jpg/aid30279-v4-728px-Regain-Trust-in-Someone-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nRecognize that we all make mistakes and think about the times you've received forgiveness.

If you want to earn a girl's trust back, the very first thing you should do is to apologize sincerely about lying and hurting her. Whether you cheated on her, lied about spending a weekend with your friends in Vegas instead of at your grandmother's, or lied about a significant personal detail, it's inevitable that she's feeling hurt, confused, and like she doesn't know you anymore. Let her know that you understand how difficult you have made things for her, and that you deeply regret what you've done. Take FULL responsibility, show her you know you were wrong.[1] She's not going to go for a half-hearted apology. It needs to be sincere and real. \n\nDon't just say \"I'm sorry\" because you think it's the right thing to do -- say it because you mean it. If you're not sincere, she'll be able to tell.\nWhen you tell her you're sorry, look into her eyes, speak slowly, and face your body toward her so she knows she has all of your attention.\nYou don't have to say that you're sorry a hundred times -- it's about quality, not quantity.\nLet her know that you understand all of the pain and suffering that you've caused her. If she doesn't think you understand her pain, she won't want to listen to you.\nThough you shouldn't make this all about you, let her know that you're feeling real pain because of your mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Manipulate Others Step 09\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Manipulate-Others-Step-09.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Manipulate-Others-Step-09.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe honest about why you lied. You don't have to go in too much graphic detail if you think it'll only hurt her more, but you should be honest about why you told the lie. Maybe you wanted to protect her, maybe you knew that the truth would hurt her, or maybe you were even embarrassed about the truth and wanted to cover it up. Whatever your reason, let her know why you did it -- this will show that you're already maturing and trying to reflect, and that you're not just going to move on without gaining some perspective.[2]\n\nBeing honest about why you lied will make her feel like you're more likely to be honest in the future.\nLetting her know your motives will help her understand your perspective.\nKnow when it's better not to be honest. If you just wanted to get with another girl because you were feeling bored or restless, then it's better to keep that to yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be Likable Step 05\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Be-Likable-Step-05.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Be-Likable-Step-05.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nPromise it will never happen again -- and mean it. First, you have to make sure that it really won't happen again. If you doubt yourself or your future self and think you may make the same mistake, then spare the girl and work on fixing yourself before you get entangled with anyone else. If you don't think that you should be trusted, then why should anyone else disagree? Once you're certain that it won't happen again, then you should promise her that you're determined not to repeat your mistakes.[3]\n\nBe sincere when you tell her this. Don't make an empty promise.\nLet her know that you understand that actions speak louder than words, but make it clear that from now on, your actions will match your promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Better Boyfriend Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/50/Be-a-Better-Boyfriend-Step-10.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Be-a-Better-Boyfriend-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nPromise you'll change. Tell her that you're going to work on becoming a better, more complete person who wouldn't lie to her. Be open about the fact that you know that this is a process and that you won't change overnight, but let her know that you're willing to try to change for her. If you have a concrete plan for how you'll change, whether it's by keeping a journal, going to therapy, or just trying to be a more honest, more reflective person, then let her know what you'll do so you'll sound more sincere.\nAgain, make it clear that you know this won't happen overnight, but that you want to put in the work because earning her trust back is the most important thing to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nEarning Her Trust Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Let a Guy Friend Know You're Not Interested Romantically in a Nice Way Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e7/Let-a-Guy-Friend-Know-You%27re-Not-Interested-Romantically-in-a-Nice-Way-Step-10.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Let-a-Guy-Friend-Know-You%27re-Not-Interested-Romantically-in-a-Nice-Way-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGive her space. Once you've told her everything you want to say, it's time to give her some space. The worst thing you can do to earn a girl's trust back is to call her or show up at her place constantly until she feels completely suffocated by you. Instead, let her know that you'll be stepping back and waiting for her to reach out when she's ready. This doesn't mean that you should completely cease communication, but it does mean that you should back off for a while until she's ready to talk to you.\n\nYou can check in with a text or a phone call every few days, but only if she does sound like she wants to talk to you -- however reluctantly.\nIf you want to be sweet, you can send her flowers, but don't overdo it. If she's really angry, then she won't be ready for your gifts.\nYou can do something small, like write her a letter, to let her know that she's on your mind without overwhelming her.\nIf you do run in to her, be kind and friendly, but don't talk to her for too long or make her feel like she's getting ambushed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Earn a Girl's Trust Back After Lying Step 06\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Earn-a-Girl%27s-Trust-Back-After-Lying-Step-06.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Earn-a-Girl%27s-Trust-Back-After-Lying-Step-06.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGive it time. Giving it time is just as important as giving the girl space. You have to be patient and wait for her to come around instead of forcing it and pretending like everything is exactly like it was before. To do this, you'll have to be patient, even if you are hanging out a lot, and know that the girl won't rush back into your arms after you've lied. Don't ask her if she forgives you every two seconds, and don't try to book elaborate vacations or to go on romantic dates; instead, take it slow, and wait for her to make the move.\n\nEven if you are hanging out again, don't expect things to be the same. Be more cautious about touching, complementing, or generally spending time with her.\nDon't get frustrated. It's natural that you wish that everything was completely forgotten instantly, but that's not the way the world works.\nAct natural. You don't have to bring up your lie all the time. Just be more cautious without being too obvious about it, and wait for her to trust you again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make Women Melt Step 09\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Make-Women-Melt-Step-09.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Make-Women-Melt-Step-09.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe dependable. If you want your girl to trust you again, then you have to be absolutely dependable, even if you weren't in the past.[4] This means that you have to be there for her if she needs help, to follow through on your plans, and to show up to your dates on time -- or even a little early. If you're not dependable after lying to her, she'll be even less inclined to trust you.\n\nGo out of your way to be helpful and supportive. Let her see that you'll be there for her. Even if you didn't go watch her basketball games before, show up to watch a few games after school to show that you care.\nLet her open up and talk to you about her problems. This will show that she's starting to trust you again.\nYou should be dependable, but that doesn't mean you should become her lap dog or servant -- maintain your own identity while being as helpful as possible. You don't want her to think that you're downright groveling, or that won't be very attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be the Guy Women Want Step 08\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Be-the-Guy-Women-Want-Step-08.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Be-the-Guy-Women-Want-Step-08.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe accessible. If you want to earn your girl's trust back, then you have to be easily accessible. Though you don't need to give her a copy of your schedule, she should have a sense of where you are most of the time, or she'll start to worry again. If she calls or texts you, you should try to get back to her as soon as you can. If you leave her waiting more than a few hours, or even a day, then she'll start doubting your ability to change.\n\nYou can casually let her know what you'll be up to when she's not around. If you're going to a baseball game with your friends, let her know, and get her a teddy bear with your favorite team's logo on it. If you're going to your uncle's beach house, send her a picture of the ocean and say you wish she was there.\nDon't be mysterious. If you're hanging out but you have to get going, tell her why.\nThis doesn't mean that she has to keep tabs on you or stick a GPS locator to your car -- it does mean that she has a general sense of what you're doing so she can trust you.\nEven if you're away for a few days, don't forget to check in. Try to call at least once a day and send her a few texts a day to let her know you're thinking of her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Earn a Girl's Trust Back After Lying Step 09\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/39/Earn-a-Girl%27s-Trust-Back-After-Lying-Step-09.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Earn-a-Girl%27s-Trust-Back-After-Lying-Step-09.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nContinue being honest. As you and the girl start to spend more time together, keep up your honesty. Level with her if you're feeling upset, confused, or hurt, and let her know if you feel smothered or like you're not being yourself. She'll want to know how you're feeling so that she has an insight into what's really going on in your mind. If you're not honest with her again, and she finds out, then it's over.\nJust stay patient and continue to let her know what's on your mind. This will slowly make her trust you again. You don't have to tell her everything that you're thinking, but you should make a conscious effort to be open with her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nKeeping Her Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Better Husband Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Be-a-Better-Husband-Step-10.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Be-a-Better-Husband-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMake her feel special. You may have started to earn the girl's trust back, but how do you keep it? You have to make her feel special so that she knows that she means a lot to you, and that you won't go and lie whenever you feel like it. To make her feel special, you should act like a gentleman, take her out on romantic dates, compliment her looks and personality, and show an interest in her hobbies, thoughts, and goals.[5]\n\nIf she looks beautiful, don't be afraid to tell her.\nSend her flowers or a love poem, if it feels natural for you.\nAsk her opinion on anything that matters to you, whether it's your new haircut or current events.\nTake an interest in her life. Ask her about her family, her latest chem exam, or even show an interest in her childhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make Women Melt Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Make-Women-Melt-Step-11.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Make-Women-Melt-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nOpen up to her. If you want to keep the girl's trust, then you have to learn to really open up to her. Tell her things about yourself that you haven't told many people -- or that you haven't told anyone, even -- and make her see that you really trust and care about her. If you tell her personal or private information, then she'll see that you really value her judgment and reaction, and that you want to be really honest with her.\n\nYou don't have to tell her anything that makes you uncomfortable. Just make her see that you trust her with your personal moments, and hopefully she'll reciprocate.\nIf you take the time to let her really know you, she'll appreciate it and will see how sincere you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Ask Out a Girl at School Step 05\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Ask-Out-a-Girl-at-School-Step-05.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Ask-Out-a-Girl-at-School-Step-05.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe true to yourself. If you really want to keep the girl's trust, then you have to be true to who you really are. Though it's likely that you've had to make some major changes in your life to ensure that you won't lie again, you shouldn't change who you are completely just to earn the girl's trust. If you feel like you're groveling, sucking up, or just spending all of your energy on winning her over, then you're not really being who you are, and neither she nor you will be happy with that.\nAsk yourself if you feel comfortable in your own skin, and if you feel like the girl is trusting the real you -- not some new guy you've created just to win her over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play a Player Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Play-a-Player-Step-17.jpg/aid115613-v4-728px-Play-a-Player-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKnow when it's too late.

You're better off ending the relationship before both of you get even more hurt, and cause more pain by trying to fix something that's too broken to be repaired.\n\nIf you feel like you've been patient and have given the relationship your all and that your girl still won't trust you, then it may be best to part ways.\nIf it's really not working, then you're better off starting over with someone new -- as long as you've learned from your mistakes.\nOnce you recognize that it's really too late, you should move on as soon as you can.

If your partner confronts you about a lie, resist the impulse to get defensive or to justify your actions. Trying to deny the lie or make excuses will ultimately undermine your partner’s trust in you even more. No matter what your reasons may have been, take full ownership of your actions—admit the lie and don’t try to place the blame on anyone else.[1]\n\nFor example, you might say, “You’re right. I know I told you I wasn’t going to smoke anymore, but I gave in to temptation and had a couple cigarettes last night when I was out with my friends. I was afraid of what you’d think, so I lied about it when you asked me.”\nIdeally, you should own up to your lie before your partner finds out about it. Waiting for them to uncover the lie and confront you can ultimately make it harder for you to repair the damage.\nAlways acknowledge your partner’s feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Accept Blame when You Deserve It Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Accept-Blame-when-You-Deserve-It-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Accept-Blame-when-You-Deserve-It-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nApologize sincerely for the lie. Tell your partner you are sorry for lying to them in plain and simple terms. It’s okay to offer an explanation for your actions, but don’t try to excuse yourself. Keep your apology clear and to the point, and use “I” language.    \n\nA true apology should start with “I’m sorry I” rather than “I’m sorry you” or “I’m sorry but.”[2]\n\nTry saying something like, “I’m sorry I lied to you about getting into that fender bender. I was afraid you’d be mad, but I should have just been truthful.”\nYour apology should not minimize the seriousness of the lie or place any blame on your partner for the situation or their feelings (e.g., “I’m sorry you’re so upset.

After you’ve apologized, let your partner say their piece. They may be sad, disappointed, or angry with you. Although it might be painful to hear them express these feelings, it’s important to acknowledge their emotions and let them know you are hearing their concerns.[3]\n\nDon’t interrupt your partner while they are speaking. Even if what they have to say upsets you, wait for them to finish before you respond.\nShow that you are listening by using verbal and visual cues (such as making eye contact, nodding, and saying things like “Right,” or “I understand.”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Answer when Someone Asks How You Are Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Answer-when-Someone-Asks-How-You-Are-Step-4.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Answer-when-Someone-Asks-How-You-Are-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAnswer their questions openly and honestly.

Answer their questions to the best of your ability, without getting defensive or evasive. This will help make it clear to them that you are committed to being more honest and truthful going forward.[4]\nIf your partner feels hurt and betrayed by the lie, they may ask a lot of questions to try to help themselves come to terms with what happened. Be patient and do your best to answer, even if their questions seem repetitive or irrelevant to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nMoving Forward in the Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Communicate with a Girl when She Is Not Around Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Communicate-with-a-Girl-when-She-Is-Not-Around-Step-16.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Communicate-with-a-Girl-when-She-Is-Not-Around-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPractice transparency and accountability. In the aftermath of a lie, your partner will need to see evidence that you’re being truthful and not trying to hide anything.[5] Take care to let them know what you’re doing and what you’ve been up to, especially in situations related to the lie. If they ask questions, answer honestly. \n\nFor example, if you lied to your partner about going to the bar every night after work, check in to tell them where you are after you get off work.\nIf you do something you know your partner won’t like, don’t cover it up—just let them know right away. They may be upset with you, but they will also feel reassured that you are making an effort to be honest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be Friends With Someone Who Talks Too Much Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Be-Friends-With-Someone-Who-Talks-Too-Much-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Be-Friends-With-Someone-Who-Talks-Too-Much-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe consistent and reliable in your behavior. Apologizing and promising to make a change are good first steps, but they will not be enough. Demonstrate to your partner through regular and consistent actions that you have made a genuine commitment to being trustworthy. If you say you are going to do something, follow through and do it.[6]\nFor example, if you tell your partner you are going to be home by a particular time every night, make sure to be there. If something comes up that prevents you from being home by that time, call them as soon as you can and tell them honestly what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Choose the Right Partner in Life Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Choose-the-Right-Partner-in-Life-Step-9.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Choose-the-Right-Partner-in-Life-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTalk to your partner about setting some ground rules. Re-establishing trust will require some teamwork. Ask your partner to help you develop a list of things you can do to help them feel more confident in you and the relationship. Check in with them occasionally to make sure you are satisfactorily meeting those needs.[7]\nFor example, if you’ve lied about your spending habits, your partner might say, “I’d feel better if we could sit down and look at our finances together once a week.” When it’s time to do that, take the initiative and say, “Hey, it’s Friday. Should we pull up the bank account?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Give People Advice Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Give-People-Advice-Step-10.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Give-People-Advice-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nAllow yourself to be vulnerable with your partner. It’s hard to stay honest if you’re constantly behind a defensive wall. Practice opening up to your partner about your fears, wants, needs, strengths, and weaknesses. The more you let your partner see who you really are and how you’re really feeling, the easier it will be for you to be truthful and for them to trust you. Being open may also help your partner to better understand where you are coming from.\n\nBeing vulnerable does not mean being weak. In fact, it requires a great deal of bravery to open up to another person and really be yourself, especially if you’re afraid of judgment or criticism.[8]\n\nIf you’ve lied in part because of your insecurities about your relationship with your partner, be open about that, too. For example, you might say, “When I slip up and have a cigarette, I’m always scared to tell you because I know you’re going to yell at me and judge me for giving in.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Argue With Someone Who Thinks They Are Always Right Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8b/Argue-With-Someone-Who-Thinks-They-Are-Always-Right-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Argue-With-Someone-Who-Thinks-They-Are-Always-Right-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nGive your partner (and the relationship) time to heal. Be persistent in your efforts to change, and don’t give up if your partner still doesn’t seem to trust you right away. You probably won’t be able to fix the broken trust in your relationship in a few days or even a few weeks. The timeframe will vary depending on the seriousness of your lie and the personalities and histories of you and your partner, but things should eventually get better if you stay consistent and honest.[9]\nDon’t push your partner to “get over it” or move on before they are ready. A betrayal of trust can be deeply hurtful, and it’s important for you to acknowledge and respect the seriousness of the pain they are feeling. Even now, some of your actions may remind them of the time that you lied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nGetting Professional Help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Find a Sex Therapist Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/07/Find-a-Sex-Therapist-Step-14.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Find-a-Sex-Therapist-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nFind a couples counselor. If you feel like the hurt and mistrust resulting from the lie are too severe for you and your partner to fix on your own, couples counseling may be a good option. Do a web search for counselors in your area, or use an online directory.[10]\n\nA good counselor can help you work together to develop strategies for rebuilding your trust in one another. They can also help you determine the underlying causes of lying and mistrust in your relationship, and work with you on ways to resolve those issues.[11]\n\nYou may need to work with more than one counselor before you find one who’s a good fit for you and your partner. Look for someone who works well with your personalities, whose values mesh with your own, and who is focused on finding ways to help you overcome the problems in your relationship as a team.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal with Relatives Who Undermine Your Parenting Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Deal-with-Relatives-Who-Undermine-Your-Parenting-Step-14.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Deal-with-Relatives-Who-Undermine-Your-Parenting-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nJoin a support group for couples with relationship issues. Support groups can be helpful because they give you a chance to meet and gain insights from other couples who are facing similar struggles. Ask your therapist or doctor to recommend a support group in your area, or do an online search for relationship support groups. \nSupport groups can be either peer-led or run by a professional host or mediator (such as a psychologist or licensed clinical social worker).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if You Are Heterosexual Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Know-if-You-Are-Heterosexual-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid10513233-v4-728px-Know-if-You-Are-Heterosexual-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTry individual therapy if you need help with your own issues. People lie for many reasons, but sometimes it can be a sign of a deeper underlying issue. If you and your partner have both worked hard to overcome any major problems in your relationship and you still can’t stop lying, it may benefit you to talk to a counselor on your own to get to the bottom of the problem and develop a plan to help you stop. \nYou may lie because you are embarrassed to tell the truth, because it helps you feel more secure and in control, because you think the lies make you look better to others, or even because you feel the lie will help another person or prevent them from being hurt.[13] Whatever the reason, a good therapist can help you find healthier and more honest ways of dealing with those issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust","title":"How to Gain Someone's Trust\n","content":["\n\nMethod 1\n\nDemonstrating Trustworthiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nBe reliable.[1] Your dependability will initially be tested with small things. Even if these things seem insignificant, they matter when you’re trying to develop trust. For example, always return things that you borrow undamaged.[2] If you say you are going to be somewhere, show up and be on time. When you say you’re going to do something, no matter how small, do it.\n\nEvery time you prove that you’re dependable, trust grows.\nNo one is perfect. Occasionally you are going to be late, lose a borrowed book, or forget about something you said you would do. When this happens, apologize and own up to it immediately.\nIf you have to break plans that you have made with someone, then make sure to call and let the person know as soon as possible. Try not to do this too often though because it can have a negative effect on your relationship if you are always canceling at the last minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/85/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nKeep their secrets confidential.[3] Prove that you can be trusted by respecting their privacy.[4] Never share any confidential information that they give you. If you do, that person probably won’t feel comfortable trusting you with their secrets again for a long time, if ever. The only time you should consider breaking a confidence is if the person is in some kind of life-threatening danger and you need to alert someone.\n\nEven then, the person will probably be angry with you for breaking their confidence.\nIf this happens, apologize and explain that you only did it because you were truly worried about their safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/93/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe honest.[5] When someone learns that you've lied to them, they're naturally going to assume it will happen again. Be truthful with them, even when it’s hard. If you think telling them the truth might hurt their feelings, try to find a considerate way to tell them. If you make a mistake, take responsibility and own up to it.[6] Be upfront with them. Don’t let them find out about it some other way.\n\nWork on showing that you’re an honest person – even if your friend isn’t directly involved in the situation.[7]\n\nIf they witness you being honest about other things and with other people, it will make them feel like you’ll be honest with them, too.\nIf you need to be honest with your friend about a difficult topic, try starting off like this, \"Jen, I really love how our honest our friendship is, and I want to keep it that way. I need to talk to you about something...\"\nYou could also bring up the topic like this, \"Eric, this is hard to tell you, but I'm your friend and I feel like you should know about this...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/96/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTrust them first. By sharing something personal with your friend, it shows that you feel a sense of trust around them. Relationships are give-and-take situations. Sometimes, in order to receive something, you have to demonstrate that you're willing to give it. By trusting them first, you are showing them it’s safe for them to do the same thing.\n\nFor example, you could ask for their advice about a personal problem you’re experiencing, or go to them for help on a project.\nYou could start off by saying, \"Danielle, I know I can trust you. I really need to talk to someone I trust about this...\"\nYou could also say, \"Jim, this is kind of embarrassing, but I am failing algebra right now. If my parents knew, I'd be in serious trouble. You're great at algebra, do you think you could help me?\"\nYou might feel vulnerable at first, but learning to trust someone usually begins by putting yourself out there.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nBuilding a Healthy Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/59/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nShow kindness, respect, and acceptance.[9] To build trust, it is important to show that you are kind, respectful, and accepting of the other people. Be understanding and show them compassion when they need it. Always respect their thoughts and beliefs, even when they are different from yours.[10]\n\nIf you disagree on something, be respectful about it. For instance, don’t say, “I don’t believe in your religion at all. It sounds really weird.”\nInstead, say something like, “My beliefs are pretty different, but that’s ok! I respect all religions.”\nAlso, be accepting of your friend. Don’t try to get your friend to change for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/77/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-6.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nSpend time with them. Trust is built over time, so be ready and willing to invest time in someone if you want to gain their trust. Each time you hang out, it’s an opportunity to have positive interactions and show your trustworthiness. Avoid only being around them when things are going well. Be there for them during the ups and the downs.[11]\n\nYour willingness to be around them when they’re going through a hard time shows them that they matter to you.\nYou aren’t hanging around just to have fun and enjoy the good times – you want to have a real friendship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bb/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-7.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe sincere.[12] Meaningless flattery and only telling someone what they want to hear isn’t the same thing as kindness. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but you also don’t want to lie to them. Avoid being vague with them. Be specific and really mean the things you say. For example, if your friend asks you how they look in an outfit and it doesn’t look flattering, don’t automatically say, “It looks great!” when you know it doesn't.\n\nHowever, you also don’t want to say, “Honestly, you look a bit overweight in that.”\nInstead, you could say something like, “That color looks awesome on you! I like the style of the outfit, but I’m not sure about the neckline. Let’s look for something else in that color.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/18/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-8.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe accessible.[13] When your friend texts or calls you, try to reply or call them back as soon as you can. If they send you a text and you don’t respond for days, it creates the illusion that you either don’t care enough to reply, or you’re busy doing something that you can’t talk to them about. Try to be available when they need you.\n\nFor example, if you’re busy at the library and your friend texts you, send a quick response like, “In study group right now! Will get back to you ASAP.”\nAnother example: If you’re on a vacation with your family and you’re going to be busy for days, don’t leave them hanging. Respond with, “Out of town with my family – we’re skiing! Will be back Sunday – I’ll call you.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-9.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nListen without making judgments. When someone tells you a story or expresses a feeling, it is important to listen without making judgments. Make sure that you keep an open mind when you listen to people and do not express judgment for the things they share with you.\n\nFor example, if a friend shares with you that she had a one night stand with someone, don’t tell her that she shouldn’t have done that or try to give her unsolicited advice about what to do. Just listen to her and offer your support if she expresses worry over the situation.\nAvoid thinking about what you are going to say next. Just focus on what the person is saying.[14]\n\nPay attention to their facial expressions and body language as well to get insight into how they are feeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nShowing Loyalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-10.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAvoid gossiping.[15] Never gossip about your friend to other people – most of the time, they are going to find out about it. It’s hard to rebuild trust when someone feels that you’ve betrayed them in this way. You should also avoid gossiping to your friend about other people. When you do this, it plants the idea in their head that you might also gossip about them, too.\n\nWhen you gossip with someone, it can sometimes feel like you’re bonding with them because you’re sharing privileged information together.\nHowever, this is not a healthy way to bond with your friend. Nothing positive ever results from gossiping.\nIf you hear other people gossiping about your friend, stand up for them. This will very clearly demonstrate your loyalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/73/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-11.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nKeep your promises.[16] Each time you break a promise, trust decreases. Be true to your word and avoid making promises that you can’t keep. If you do break a promise and it’s something minor, be sincerely apologetic and try to make it up to them in some way. The damage is usually minor in this situation. If you break an important promise, however, things are going to be a lot harder to make right.\n\nDepending on the nature of the broken promise, gaining their trust may no longer be possible.\nThe best approach is to avoid making promises that you can’t keep. Always try your best to keep the promises you do make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-12.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe supportive. Support your friend’s dreams and goals, even when no one else does. Encourage them when they lose hope.[17] Always have their back and show them that you can be counted on to be there for them. When someone knows that you are going to be supportive, they will feel more comfortable sharing things with you.\n\nFor example, \"Darrell, I know how much you want to get into film school. I know your parents don't agree, but I think you have what it takes to get in. I got a really nice camera for Christmas, but I honestly don't use it much. I want you to have it...\"\nBeing supportive doesn’t mean always being in favor of everything they do, especially when it’s harmful or dangerous for them.\nAlways try to make it clear that you want the best for them.[18] If you aren’t supportive of something, explain to them why. Be honest with them.\nFor instance, in a negative situation, you could say, \"Whitney, I'm your best friend and I want the best for you. I would never be unsupportive of any of your choices unless I felt truly worried about you. I honestly feel like your new boyfriend is a bad influence on you...\"\nMake sure that you remember important dates as well, such as anniversaries, birthdays, and other special dates in your relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Gain Someone's Trust Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1a/Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-13.jpg/aid2981547-v4-728px-Gain-Someone%27s-Trust-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nHelp them.[19] Be there for them, even when you aren’t asked. If you see a friend struggling, do what you can to help them through it. For instance, if your friend is failing a subject in school, don’t just sit back and watch. Offer to help them with their homework and study with them.\nIf you step in to help them with something when the chips are down, without even being asked, they will feel like they can count on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Rebuild-Trust","title":"How to Rebuild Trust\n","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nTaking Responsibility for your Actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Transgender Guy Talking.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Transgender-Guy-Talking.png/728px-Transgender-Guy-Talking.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nCome clean. If you are the one who betrayed someone else, you need to come clean. In interpersonal relationships, it's especially important to tell the truth when you would benefit from a lie.[3] If you have betrayed someone, coming clean at your own expense tells the other person that their well-being is more important than your own.[4] Denial will only make the other party's distrust run deeper, especially if the truth is already clear. \nAdmit all of your mistakes. Even if there are parts that you can keep hidden without getting caught, you should still reveal them to the other person. Only in admitting all your mistakes can you be forgiven for all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Man Helps Unhappy Child.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9d/Man-Helps-Unhappy-Child.png/728px-Man-Helps-Unhappy-Child.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nExpect an emotional reaction from the other person. Admitting that you betrayed someone is not going to make things easier immediately. On the contrary, you can expect an emotional outburst—yelling, crying, and so on—from the other person when she hears you admit your betrayal. But remember, the best way to move on is by putting it all into the open. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Guy Gives Flower to Sad Woman.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Guy-Gives-Flower-to-Sad-Woman.png/728px-Guy-Gives-Flower-to-Sad-Woman.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nApologize. This one should be obvious, but unfortunately, sometimes it gets overlooked. How you approach saying your apology will influence whether or not the apology is accepted and you both can move on.[5]\n\nWhen apologizing, avoid justifying your actions.[6] Don't claim that the offended person misunderstood you (“you read that wrong”). Don't deny their hurt (“you didn't even get hurt”). Don't tell a sad tale (“I had a troubled childhood”).\nThe best way to accept responsibility is by recognizing the other person's hurt, saying what you should have done instead, and doing that behavior in the future.[7]\n\nLet the person you betrayed know why you are apologizing. If they know that you are apologizing out of guilt and shame, they are more likely to forgive you. If they think that you are apologizing out of pity, they are less likely to forgive you. Pity, unlike guilt and shame, does not show an element of personal responsibility of the offender. Pity also implies that the offender is superior to the offended.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Woman Hugging Cat.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Woman-Hugging-Cat.png/728px-Woman-Hugging-Cat.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nForgive yourself. When you violate someone's trust, you may feel so regretful that you have a hard time forgiving yourself for the violation. While a repentant heart is an essential part of making up with the person you betrayed, you also need to accept and learn to forgive yourself after you put the effort into making amends. \n\nRemember that no one is perfect. Whether your error in judgment was minor or major, it goes to show that you are only human. Accept your failure, and try to push forward into the future.\nBy clinging to thoughts of past failure, you risk devaluing yourself. Once you begin to have such thoughts, it could zap your motivation for self-improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nMoving Forward If You Betrayed Someone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Silly Man and Woman On Phone.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Silly-Man-and-Woman-On-Phone.png/728px-Silly-Man-and-Woman-On-Phone.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMake your life transparent for the other person. Everybody wants to control personal information.[9] But, for a little while, you may need to forfeit a portion of your privacy for the sake of the person trying to trust you again. By making your life transparent, the other person will be able to confirm with their own eyes that you are not in the midst of another betrayal. \nThis is especially important in romantic relationships broken apart by infidelity. Give your significant other complete, uncensored access to your texts, phone logs, emails, and appointment book for a few weeks to months after your betrayal. Let him or her know where you are and who you are with whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Man and Worried Woman.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6b/Man-and-Worried-Woman.png/728px-Man-and-Worried-Woman.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLet the other person vent.[10] Hard feelings are natural after any betrayal. The person who feels betrayed will need to vent their emotions and thoughts to heal. It might be unpleasant for you, but it is essential for the other person. \n\nOne of the worst things you can do is attempt to get them to “shut up” while expressing their anger. This action shows that you are not taking this person's feelings seriously.\nLet the other person vent at their own pace. Everyone goes about things in a different way and in a different time period. Rushing the other person shows a lack of consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Confident Woman.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Confident-Woman.png/728px-Confident-Woman.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nKeep your word going forward. Actions speak louder than words. Trust between two people means that you have to be dependable and consistent over a long period of time.[11] You should make a promise to do better, but a promise or apology alone with only restore trust short-term.[12] If you can't be honest in the future, or cannot do all that you promise to do, the person you betrayed will be unable to accept that you have changed or that you are worthy of being trusted again. \nYou should avoid making the same mistake at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Confused Woman.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/73/Confused-Woman.png/728px-Confused-Woman.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nStay patient. Understand that rebuilding trust takes time. Be patient with the other person, but be persistent in your own efforts. \n\nDepending on the severity of your betrayal, building trust can take weeks, months, or years.\nNever pressure the other person into showing you more trust.\nUnderstand that things may never be quite the same after your betrayal, but if you show that you are a trustworthy person, some level of trust can usually be revived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nGetting Ready to Trust Someone Again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Transgender Guy Thinking.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Transgender-Guy-Thinking.png/728px-Transgender-Guy-Thinking.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAssess the situation. Before you can rebuild trust in someone after they betrayed you, you should first ask yourself if the relationship is one you want to salvage. Ask yourself: \n\nIs this the first time this person betrayed me?\nWill I really be able to trust this person again, even if they do everything perfectly from now on?\nAm I able to forgive?\nIs the relationship I have with this person important enough to fight for?\nIs this a one-time mistake or a pattern of behavior?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Upset Girl Walks Away from Man.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Upset-Girl-Walks-Away-from-Man.png/728px-Upset-Girl-Walks-Away-from-Man.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nConsider the person's reaction to the situation. Do they seem genuinely sorry for hurting you, or sorry that they got caught? Are they willing to listen to you and make an effort to do better next time? Are they willing to accept blame? \nIf they don't seem to truly regret hurting you, or aren't interested in making things better, then this relationship probably isn't worth your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Woman Listens to Man.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/83/Woman-Listens-to-Man.png/728px-Woman-Listens-to-Man.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nKeep an eye out for continued deception. Continue to assess the situation as you progress. After a few weeks to months, you should be able to notice signs of trustworthiness in the person who betrayed you. Trying to determine whether someone is lying is tricky business, but the following clues might signal deception:[13]\n\nPeople who are lying take longer to respond, and say less when they do.\nA liar tells more far-fetched stories and use fewer details. They are also less direct, have more pauses, and use fewer gestures.\nLiars are less likely than those telling the truth to correct themselves.\nPeople who lie are more tense. This make their voices sound higher, and they are more likely to fidget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Upset Woman Talks to Man.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Upset-Woman-Talks-to-Man.png/728px-Upset-Woman-Talks-to-Man.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nExpress your feelings. Let the person who betrayed you know just how deeply you were hurt by their actions. Most importantly, tell your betrayer exactly what it was that hurt you. Tell them what you need so that you will start trusting that person again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 4\n\nMoving Forward if Someone Betrayed You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Man Relaxes.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Man-Relaxes.png/728px-Man-Relaxes.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTry to let go of your anger. Once you let out your anger, let it go. After you have discussed the betrayal, you need to let it stay in the past. Even if you feel sad or angry now, you won't feel this way forever. Don't bring it up in future arguments, especially if the other person has shown an effort to make amends for the action. \nIf you still notice that you are holding onto your negative feelings, think about why you are having trouble letting go. Is it because your partner is still behaving in a way that betrays your trust? Or is it because of your personal issues related to your own past history?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Football.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5c/Football.png/728px-Football.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nAdjust your expectations. Even if someone never wants to hurt you, no one will be able to give you exactly what you need, 100 percent of the time. Once you understand that you should not expect perfection, you can get a better idea of how much trust you actually can put in the other person. [14]\nThe goal is to be realistic, not to let yourself get walked all over. Accept that everyone can slip up here and there. However, don't ever let anyone get away with hurting you intentionally or with intentional neglect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Woman Rests Head on Woman's Shoulder.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Woman-Rests-Head-on-Woman%27s-Shoulder.png/728px-Woman-Rests-Head-on-Woman%27s-Shoulder.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive and receive love. You need to be willing to accept and love the person who betrayed you, and you also need to accept the love that person gives you in return. When your betrayer tries to express affection, accept that the acts of affection are the real thing. Try to accept an action that seems honest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship","title":"How to Build Trust in a Relationship","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nCommitting to Mutual Core Relationship Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ea/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nStay faithful. If a partner is not loyal, a relationship quickly becomes unworkable. People do recover from an affair but usually need professional help to do it. Make a commitment to be faithful and stick to it. If you’re not happy in the relationship, get counseling and not a part-time lover.[2]\n\nIf you’re faithful to someone, it means you’re faithful on all levels. This means physically but also emotionally. Some people think it’s okay to establish intimate bonds even though they may just be spending time with another person and nothing else, but it’s really not. It will eventually cause problems in your relationship.\nBe clear with appropriate boundaries as much as possible. What is appropriate varies from culture to culture, and often with one's age. But it all comes down to understanding what is respectful, clear, and comfortable to ask from a romantic relationship.\nDating a person once is not a committed relationship, for instance. If asking a person out on a date, make sure that is clear; it can be awkward if a woman is not entirely sure she is at a restaurant as a friend or as a date.\nBe clear on if you see your sexual relationship as more casual or more serious. Some people are comfortable with \"booty calls\" and \"friends with benefits\" types of relationships. Others see sexual relations as a very deeply emotional act done only with someone committed to a relationship (or after marriage).\nThere are wide varieties of behaviors considered a \"committed relationship,\" from traditional marriage, to \"live-in boyfriend or girlfriend\", to more radical \"open marriages,\" and polyamory. A person seeking a traditional marriage may be disappointed if the partner is looking for something else. Likewise, someone seeking something else may be disappointed if the partner is looking for a traditional marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c6/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGive your partner space, and foster kindness. Trust builds in an atmosphere of security and safety. The cycle of hurting each other, either verbally or physically, and then rejecting the other person, creates a lot of fear; which undermines trust. Furthermore, trying to control your partner’s every move is another type of mistrust, so make sure you’re not possessively clinging on to your partner. That will only push him or her away. [3]\nIf your significant other wants to spend time with their friends, try to be okay with that. You can always talk about what’s acceptable behavior and what’s not, though. For instance, if your partner says that he or she wants to go to a dance club with friends, and you’re not comfortable with it; then it’s something that you need to talk about, both in this instance, and for the future, so that it doesn’t keep happening again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4b/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nLove your partner without any ulterior motives. Both of you need to feel sure you are loved for yourself, and not for some other reason. Those other reasons could be your family, your money, your looks, or even just the fear of being alone. Make sure you’re with your significant other for the right reasons.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nMake your relationship a top priority. It can be easy to take each other for granted and neglect one another. Try not to give all of your energy and time to other people or activities. Keep your priorities clear. If being in a relationship is important to you, then make sure it stays at the top of your list.[5]\nAvoid becoming a workaholic because this can get in the way of your relationship. Make time for your relationship; and if you need to reach a goal at a specific time, work with your partner to develop solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nStay to the end. Misunderstandings, conflict, and anger are going to occur. Make it safe for disagreements and the careful expression of anger to happen without raising a fear of abandonment.

A lot of people believe that mixing things up all the time makes a great relationship. In other words, he or she is always planning something new to surprise the other. Although surprises are nice from time to time, stability and uniformity are far more important in a relationship. Uniformity sounds boring, but you need to be predictable to make things work in the long run. Predictability builds trust.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe reliable. Trust is just another way of saying you can rely on someone. You trust your partner to do certain things no matter what at all times. This trust builds security in a relationship. Make sure your partner can count on you.[8]\nIf you say you’re going to be home by 5 p.m., then make sure you are or at least let the other person know if something else comes up. The most important factor here is consistency. If 4 out of 5 times, you never bother calling and just come home as late as you want, then that’s a strong indicator that your needs matter more to you than your partner. A happy, successful relationship is when both parties make an effort at keeping up their end of the bargain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMean what you say. Your partner can read your face better than anyone else. If you are lying or trying to hide some true feeling by not quite saying all that is on your mind, he or she will be able to tell. The person might even think you’re cheating. When the person knows he or she can trust whatever comes out of your mouth without hesitation, then you are building an unshakable bond.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTell the truth.

Too many people never let their partners know what they need. Don't let your partner wonder, or try to guess what he or she should do for you. It is essential this happens with both partners. If only one partner is being catered to by the other, there is a chance one will feel smothered or the other might feel neglected. Either scenario is not good.\nPractice vulnerability to allow for more closeness and intimacy in your relationship.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nSay no sometimes. It’s okay to listen to your partner’s needs and try to fulfill them, but sometimes it's just as valuable to say no. You can't do everything all the time, and you will actually earn some respect when you refuse to do something once in a while. Taking a stand, and imposing your own will can actually enhance the trust between you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nFostering Trust in Your Significant Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/12/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nHave faith in your partner's capabilities. In other words, if you believe at all that the person is not competent in some of the things he or she does, your trust will not be solid. If this is the case, you need to be upfront with him or her on the issues in an honest and loving manner. This will allow you to work through this and keep the trust with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/49/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTrust your partner. How can your partner trust you when you don't trust him or her? Having trust takes two people, and without the other person building trust, too, it's like a fish without water.\n\nThis is where you have the opportunity to practice vulnerability. Trusting another person often comes down to how you feel on the inside. In other words, if you tend to be insecure about things, then this could fall over into your relationship in a negative way. You have every reason to trust until the person actually does something that shows you cannot.\nBe open about any insecurities you may have. If you have any past experience with infidelity, let your partner know so they can understand what’s going through your head.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/21/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-14-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive the benefit of the doubt. One indicator of trust issues is the tendency to think of the worst case in every possible situation. Just because someone missed your phone call doesn’t mean the person is cheating on you. When you trust your partner, it means you give him or her the benefit of the doubt. Each person deserves a chance to explain her or himself before coming to a conclusion. Only then can it be looked at objectively.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c6/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nLeave your partner’s phone alone. Do either one of you have passwords on your phone? If so, it could be a sign that you have problems with trust. While privacy is important, it doesn’t mean your phone should be protected like it’s Fort Knox. When there’s real trust, the other person will respect your privacy even if he or she has access to your phone. But the bigger issue, however, is if you feel that the person calling your significant other’s phone is a threat to your relationship, then there are definite trust issues that need to be dealt with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Build Trust in a Relationship Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/00/Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid808266-v4-728px-Build-Trust-in-a-Relationship-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAllow your partner free reign in life. Often, when there are trust issues, you want to monitor everything the other person does and with whom. It’s easy to feel territorial and feel threatened by everyone. However, trust is about having faith and allowing the other person free reign. When you trust someone else, it also means you trust yourself, which fosters healthier relationships in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ABuilding-Trust","title":"Category: Building Trust\n","content":[]}]
