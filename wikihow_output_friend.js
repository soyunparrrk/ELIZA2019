When you’re in a group, your friend may wait for your crush to respond after they tell a story, ask a question, or make a comment. If this is the case, there’s a good chance your friend likes your crush too.[1]\nFor example, your friend BFF may ask your crush a question about their weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nWatch to see if your friend tilts their body toward your crush. When you like someone, you may naturally direct your body toward them. When you’re around both your friend and your crush, notice if your friend points their knees, feet, shoulders, or head in the direction of your crush.[2]\nIf your friend angles their chair toward your crush’s seat, this is another indication that they might like the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMake a note if your friend tries to touch your crush. If your friend lightly touches your crush’s arm, gently rubs your crush's hand, or puts their hand on your crush's back, they may be flirting. If this is the case, your friend may like your crush too.[3]\nFor instance, your friend may touch your crush’s shoulder as they say goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nPay attention if your friend is nervous or awkward around your crush. When you like someone, you often get anxious since you want to make a good impression. If your friend starts to trip over their words or act quiet and reserved in the presence of your crush, they may have feelings for them.[4]\n\nFor instance, your friend may stutter slightly or look back and forth toward your crush repetitively.\nIf your friend is shy in general, this may not indicate that they have romantic feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/06/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nObserve any flirty behavior to tell if your friend likes your crush. If your friend does things like make eye contact with your crush, flip their hair, smile when your crush is around, or laugh and giggle often, they are likely flirting with your crush. While some laughing and joking can be completely harmless, if they do these things all the time, your friend is likely crushing too.[5]\nAlso pay attention to see if your crush does any of these things toward your friend. If so, they may like your friend too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2e/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-6.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTalk about your crush to your friend and see how they respond. To get a sense of how your best friend feels, mention your crush to them in conversation. Do this casually so they don’t think you’re prying for information. For example, mention that you want to invite your crush to prom.\nYou can also say something like, “So I was hanging out with Brian in between classes. He’s really funny,” to see what they say. If your friend is not interested, they may not make a comment. If they are crushing on them too, they may express interest once you bring them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nChatting with Your Best Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/44/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-7.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nTell your friend who you’re crushing on when you develop feelings. Do this when you know you like someone to prevent competition down the line. If you keep your feelings to yourself, your friend may never know how you feel.[6]\nIf you don’t inform your friend how you feel, it’s unfair to be upset if they start to like your crush too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ab/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-8.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nAsk your friend who they're crushing on. To eliminate complications and get to the point, simply ask your friend directly who they like. You can do this after you’ve noticed your friend’s flirty or suggestive behavior. Or, do this as you mention your crush to see how they respond. This way, you are both honest and open about your feelings.[7]\n\nFor example, you can say something like, “I think I’m going to ask Heidi out to prom. Do you know who you’re asking yet?”\nFor example, your friend may mention that they’ve thought about your crush romantically but haven’t pursued it, that they have no feelings or your crush, or that your crush has expressed interested in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-9.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBring up your concerns with your friend. If your friend tells you that they like your crush, explain to them that you like them too. This situation may be a bit awkward and uncomfortable, but the best thing to do is to be truthful and direct about your feelings.[8]\nFor instance, tell your friend how long you’ve liked your crush and how strong your feelings are. They may back off if they are interested in other people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0b/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-10.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDecide whether your crush is worth losing a friendship over. Once you disclose your feelings, your friend may let you go after your crush, or they may get upset and defensive. At this point, choose if it’s worth it to lose your best friend. If you value your friendship more than the potential with your crush, explain that to your friend and go from there.[9]\nIf you’d rather go after your crush, know that you and your best friend may not be friends any longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nResponding If Your Crush Likes Your Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dc/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-11.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAccept the situation for what it is and move on. If you chat about the situation with your friend and they explain that your crush likes them, sadly there may not be much you can do about it. Try not to take the situation personally, and understand that you cannot control how people feel. At this point, it’s best to look for other fish in the sea.[10]\n\nYou may also find out your crush likes your friend after you ask them out.\nRather than asking yourself what you did wrong or why your crush doesn’t like you, try to let the situation go. This may be easier said than done, but try your best and you’ll feel better over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/eb/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-12.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe honest with your crush and your friend. Since this situation is a bit emotional and awkward, try to communicate with both your best friend and your crush. Explain to them how you feel, and whether you’re sad, depressed, jealous, hurt, or angry. The situation is easier to deal with immediately than if you try to push it away.[11]\n\nWhile explaining how you feel may not change the situation, you’ll feel better after expressing your emotions.\nFor instance, say to your friend, “I feel very hurt that you took them from behind my back.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-13.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nFocus on boosting your self-esteem and making yourself happy. You may feel upset or hurt for a bit, and that’s perfectly okay. Do what you can to boost your mood and take care of yourself. Read a book to get them off your mind, treat yourself to a spa day at home, or start a new hobby, for example.[12]\nIf you have to distance yourself from your crush and your friend, do what makes you feel better. You don’t have to hang out with them if you don’t want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1c/Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-14.jpg/aid577766-v4-728px-Know-if-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nHang out with your other friends for a positive distraction. To keep your mind off your best friend and your crush, spend time with people that make you feel good. This can be other close friends, new acquaintances, or a new love interest. [13]\nShutting yourself out when you are upset may only make you feel worse, so invest your time in social activities instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nConversation Help\n\n\n\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6d/Verbal-Signs-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush_sample.png/340px-Verbal-Signs-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nVerbal Signs Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/35/Talking-to-Your-Best-Friend-to-See-If-They-Like-Your-Crush_sample.png/340px-Talking-to-Your-Best-Friend-to-See-If-They-Like-Your-Crush_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nTalking to Your Best Friend to See If They Like Your Crush\n<img class=\"whcdn\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d4/Reacting-If-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush_sample.png/340px-Reacting-If-Your-Best-Friend-Likes-Your-Crush_sample.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"440\">\nReacting If Your Best Friend Likes Your Crush\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You","title":"How to Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nSpotting Signs of Affection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nWatch for bashfulness. In romantic movies, male leads are often men of fiery passion and debonair confidence. In real life, guys are often shy, nervous, and self-doubting - just like everyone else! If you suspect your guy friend has a crush on you, looking for the tell-tale signs and bashful shyness would be a great place to start. Does your friend seem ever-so-slightly nervous in your company? Does his laugh seem forced or unnatural? Does he seem to make an effort to perpetually laugh and smile around you, even when nothing particularly amusing is happening? These are signs that your friend is worried about what you think about him![1]\nHere are a few other things to look for:\n\nBlushing\nSlight awkwardness in conversation\nA slight reluctance or hesitation when saying \"goodbye\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLook for suspicious eye contact. People with hardcore crushes have a hard time taking their eyes off of the person their heart is set on. Does your guy friend seem to look you in the eyes more than normal conversation requires? Does he always smile when he sees you looking back? The eyes are said to be the window to the soul - even if your guy friend is too shy to admit his affection, his eyes may give away everything.[2]\nPeople who can't take their eyes off of their crush usually realize it just an instant too late. If you catch your guy friend staring at you and he seems embarrassed or pretends to look away, you may have just caught him in a moment of heartfelt longing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nLook for adoring body language. A hidden crush can often have a noticeable effect on a guy's thoughts and behavior, subtly and unconsciously changing the way he uses his body. Does your guy friend's body language seem to imply that he's giving you his full, complete attention, whether the situation calls for it or not? In other words, does he make a point to turn and face you when he speaks to you? Does he seem to \"straighten up\" when he notices you? Does he draw his shoulders back or use an arm to prop himself up on a nearby wall when he talks to you? This body language may be betraying secret feelings of affection.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/28/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTake note of \"accidental\" touching. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book! Many guys with crushes will pounce on any chance to touch the girl of their affections.[4] They'll be extra-generous with hugs, they'll always be the person to hand you something you can't reach, they'll \"accidentally\" bump into you while walking, and so on. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be a little more \"touchy\" than usual, you can be fairly certain he has feelings he's not letting on.\nSometimes, smitten guys will actually go as far as to contrive situations where they'll have to touch you. If your guy friend, for instance, seems to become extra clumsy around you and develop a habit of dropping things, pay attention to what happens when you pick them up and hand them to him - does he subtly brush your hand?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nSee whether he makes an effort to be either around you or away from you. Guy friends who secretly adore their female friend usually want to be around her as much as they can. Most of the time, guy friends harboring a secret crush will (consciously or not) gravitate towards her - standing next to her at social occasions, sitting next to her at meals, etc. Sometimes, however, a guy can be especially shy. In this case, even though he longs for his friend, her presence makes him so nervous that he'll actually find ways not to be next to her. Subtly pay attention to your guy friend's habits - if he seems to end up either right next to you or far away from you whenever you hang out in a group of people, you'll know something is up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nAnalyzing Your Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nSee whether he makes hanging out a special priority. If your guy friend likes you, hanging out with you will become one of his favorite things to do. He'll want to hang out with you as much as he can and will sometimes even cancel his other plans to be able to do so. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be contacting you to see what you're up to and find out whether you're busy every day, you may be dealing with a lovesick guy pal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nPay attention to the things you talk about together. Guys with big crushes on their lady friends will sometimes very subtly allude to their feelings in conversation. They do this in a number of ways. Some try to steer the conversation toward romantic topics, asking questions about who their female friend likes and whether she's looking for someone. Others will want to talk about the practice of dating itself, for instance, joking about how ridiculous most couples seem to be. Keep track of the types of conversations you have with your guy friend - if they mostly seem to be about romance or dating, even if he makes no indication that he's interested in dating you specifically, this may be his way of signalling his interest.\nThere's an obvious exception to this rule. If your guy friend involves you in his love life by asking you for advice with other girls, it's usually a sign that he thinks of you as a non-romantic friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e5/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nLook out for flirting. Some guys are less shy than others. Especially confident guys may even enjoy openly flirting with you. If your guy friend has developed a habit of playfully teasing you, making silly innuendos, or seems to enjoy scandalizing you, this shows that, at the very least, he's thought about you as more than a friend.\nRealize that a guy's intentions can be somewhat vague when he flirts. Many guys have a habit of flirting, then playing their flirtation off as a joke if their advances aren't immediately reciprocated. Still others flat out use flirtation and innuendo as a form of goofing off. Persistent, repeated flirtation, however, is almost always a sign of something more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKnow a \"fake date\" when it happens. Guys who wish they were dating their gal friend sometimes recreate the atmosphere of a date when they're hanging out with her. Keep an eye out for this - when you meet your guy friend for a friendly meal, does he seem a little more \"formal\" than usual? For instance, if he's normally vulgar and loud-mouthed, does he become quieter and more reserved? Does he develop good manners out of nowhere? Does he insist on paying for you? If so, your guy friend may be taking you on a \"fake date\" in an attempt to make the real thing a possibility.\nAlso, pay attention to where he takes you and how he dresses. If he takes you to fancier, \"nicer\" places than you'd normally go to while hanging out and he \"cleans up\" his appearance, you'll know you're on a fake date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nNote how he treats other girls. This is one of the most important things to look for when trying to figure out whether a guy friend is into you, but it's something that's often overlooked. If you think your guy friend is being especially affectionate with you, before jumping to conclusions, pay attention to the way he interacts with other girls. If he acts the same way around other girls that he does around you, you may be dealing with natural flirt or extrovert, rather than a secret admirer.\nListen when your guy friend talks to you about other girls. As noted above, if he openly asks you for advice on how to attract and win over other girls, he probably doesn't see you as anything more than a friend. However, if he seems unsatisfied with other girls, complaining about how he just can't seem to find the right person, this may be his way of hinting that he's interested in you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nAsking Others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAsk friends. Finding out whether your guy friend likes you or not doesn't have to be guesswork - one great way to cut right to the heart of the matter is to simply ask someone who's close to him! Most groups of guy friends talk about their crushes with each other. If your guy friend has a crush on you, there's a good chance that one or more of his friends know about it.\nIf you can, you may want to find a mutual friend - someone who's close to both you and your guy friend. Not only can this person give you helpful advice and help you plan your next steps, but, since s/he is (hopefully) loyal to you, s/he's less likely to let your secret slip.\nOn the other hand, asking someone who's friends with your guy friend and not with you can be riskier. There's a good chance with this option that the person you ask will tell your guy friend that you asked about him.

If you're really confident, the simplest, most direct way to figure out if he likes you is just to ask him to his face. This can be awfully nerve-wracking, but, usually, the temporary stress of speaking openly about your feelings is worth the closure of knowing for sure whether your guy friend likes you or not. When you ask your guy friend whether he likes you, be sure that you're in a private place, as most guys will be too shy to talk about their feelings in front of other people.\nSome guys, unfortunately, are also too shy to talk about their feelings in front of you. If you ask your guy friend directly whether he likes you or not and he says no, but he keeps flirting with you and being affectionate, you may have encountered a guy who's too shy to admit his true feelings to anyone. There's not much you can do in this case. Simply live your life and do what you want to do and eventually, this guy either will or won't gain some confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid3273292-v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Best-Guy-Friend-Likes-You-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"514\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nIf it turns out that you both like each other, ask him out! If you find out that your guy friend likes you from one of his friends or from your guy friend himself and you know that you like him back, you have no reason not to ask him out. This will probably naturally happen anyway once you both know that you like each other. Enjoy your first date - since you're already friends, you'll be able to skip the awkward small talk and enjoy your time together as a new couple!\nIn our society, there's an unspoken stereotype that guys are supposed to ask girls out and not vice versa. If your guy friend likes you but is too shy to ask you out, don't be afraid to completely ignore this outdated tradition! There's no reason that you should wait to be happy until you're asked out in the \"proper\" way, especially when the \"proper\" way is a relic of an earlier, more formal time.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29","title":"How to Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys)","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nFinding out How They Feel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/47/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nTry to find out if they have feelings for somebody else. Knowing if your best friend has romantic feelings for another person can help you deal with your feelings and know how you should proceed. If they are already in love with somebody else, you should respect their feelings and not try to interfere.[1]\n\nAsk their friends if they’re interested in somebody else. They may be able to provide insight.\nCheck your best friend’s social media to see if they’re flirting with or constantly interacting with someone else. They may have romantic feelings for them.\nIf they’re constantly talking about or bringing somebody specific up in conversations, they may like or have a crush on that person.\nJust because your best friend may have feelings for another person doesn’t mean you don’t stand a chance, but you shouldn’t try to derail their romantic relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/82/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nRead their body language for signs that they’re attracted to you. Whenever you’re hanging out or spending time with your best friend, try reading their body language for clues that they like you as more than a friend. Some body language is involuntary, but your friend may also try to exhibit body language to let you know they’re into you.[2]\n\nFor example, blushing and nervousness are involuntary reactions to being around someone you’re attracted to. But if they smile at you all the time or they take every chance to touch you, they may be trying to signal something to you.\nJust because you believe you’re picking up body language cues doesn’t mean they’re definitely attracted to you.

When you’re spending time with your best friend, try a little playful flirting. If they smile, blush, or flirt back with you genuinely, they may be attracted to you as well.[3]\n\nDon’t be inappropriate or overtly sexual or it could turn them off and ruin your chances at being with them.\nTry some innocent flirting by complimenting their appearance. Talk about something specific that will let them know you’re being genuine like, “Wow, I really like what you’re wearing. It looks great!”\nAvoid generic or plain compliments like, “I think you look good.”\n\n\n\nTip: If your best friend seems confused or upset that you’re flirting with them, try playing it off as a joke. Say something like, “Just kidding!

An easy way to find out if they’re interested in somebody else is to just ask them. You’re best friends, you can talk about anything! Keep it casual and simply ask them something like, “So, who are you crushing on these days?”[4]\n\nIf they don’t have anyone that they’re interested in, it could be a sign that they’re into you!\nDon’t worry if they do have someone they have a crush on.

It’s also harmless and won’t jeopardize your friendship if you innocently bring up the 2 of you being together.[5]\n\nTry asking them a hypothetical question like, “What would you do if we were dating?” If they give you a genuine answer that isn’t a joke, it could mean that they’re interested in you.\nSuggest the idea in a joking way by saying something like, “That’s why we could never be together. If we were dating, I wouldn’t put up with that!” If they’re not upset about the idea of being together and joke along with you, they might like the idea!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nTelling Them How You Feel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nRehearse how you plan to tell them that you love them. Having a basic script you can follow will help you remember what to say if you get nervous or lost in the moment. Write down a few talking points that you know you want to mention when you tell your best friend how you feel and practice them in front of a mirror so you can memorize them.[6]\nSay your script out loud so you can hear how it sounds and remember it.\n\n\nTip: Plan out the last thing you want to tell her so you have a goal you know you want to get to and so it sounds more powerful. For example, if you have a line like, “Chris, I just need you to know how I feel about you so I’m just going to say it. I love you,” it can help guide your conversation so you don’t just ramble on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/97/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nChoose a location that you both enjoy so the mood is positive. You’ve probably spent a lot of time with your best friend at all sorts of places. Choosing a place where you both share positive memories to tell them that you’re in love with them makes sense and won’t make the situation seem awkward.[7]\n\nIf you both go to the same restaurant or cafe often, it would be a great place to let them know how you feel.\nTry to invite them casually so they’re not anxious or stressed out about meeting you. Ask them something like, “Hey, you wanna grab a cup of coffee at the cafe?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMake an effort to look good when you meet by showering and dressing well. If you’re going to tell your best friend that you’re in love with them, you should take care of your appearance so the moment is more powerful. Take a shower, brush your teeth, fix your hair, and put on a nice outfit for the moment.[8]\n\nDress appropriately for where you plan to tell them. For example, don’t wear a t-shirt and jeans to a nice restaurant and don’t wear a tuxedo to a cafe!\nDon’t overdo the perfume or cologne so they’re not overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d8/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nStay positive and calm when you talk to them. Telling your best friend that you’re in love with them is a big moment. You don’t want to taint the memory of it by being awkward, nervous, or sullen. Try to stay positive, upbeat, and relaxed to put them at ease so they’re more receptive to what you have to tell them.[9]\n\nTake deep breaths if you feel yourself getting anxious or nervous.\nExcuse yourself to the restroom if you need a moment to calm down and collect yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys) Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4a/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid11030-v4-728px-Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBe direct and tell them that you love them. After you’ve spent some time with your best friend, start steering the conversation to how you feel.

When it comes time to tell your best friend that you’re in love with them, it’s like a band-aid, you just have to go for it.[10]\n\nFall back on the script you rehearsed and remember the talking points you worked on.\nIf they don’t give you an immediate answer, end the occasion so they can leave without feeling extra pressure.

Let them know that it’s okay if they don’t feel the same way.[12]\n\nTry saying something like, “It’s okay. You don’t have to feel the same way that I do, but I needed to tell you. I still want to be friends with you if you’re okay with that.”\nDon’t get angry or upset. Who knows, things may change in the future and you don’t want to ruin your chances.\n\n\n\nTip: Respect what they say and don’t brush them aside.

Even though there’s a very small chance that he’ll leave his relationship to be with you, that’s very rare. Generally he will find it awkward and threatening to his current relationship. Find out if he’s single to ask him out. You should also try to find out his sexuality, if you’re not sure. You should find out if he’s gay or straight or bi, to see if you have a chance, depending on your gender.[1]\nIf you’re really crushing on your friend who’s in a relationship, or isn’t into people who are your gender, try dating other people to take your mind off it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/69/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nWrite down in advance what you want to say.

If your crush is single, then it’s time for you to be brave and ask him.

It’s also best to have this conversation in private, because you’re about to be really vulnerable.[4]\n\nIf he says yes, having the conversation in private would pay off in case you two want to start kissing.\nIf you’re really too shy to ask him out in person, then you can ask him out over text.\nYou can text him something like, “Can you meet after school in the park? I have something I need to talk about with you,” or, “I need to talk with you about something.

Remind yourself about all of your good qualities, or have a friend remind you if you’re feeling too nervous.

Also, if your current crush rejects you, it does not say anything about your value as a person. Maybe the timing isn’t right, or he’s interested in someone else, or he has a lot on his mind right now.[5]\n\nGiving yourself a pep-talk will boost your self-confidence and prepare you for the conversation.\nTell yourself something like, “I am a kind, creative person and he would be lucky to date me.” Remind yourself of your qualities that you are most proud of, like your bravery, honesty, work ethic, or joy-de-vivre. Maybe you are a great dancer or a basketball player, or you always make your friends laugh. Tell yourself all the reasons you are wonderful.\nTell yourself, “I am beautiful. I am worthy of love.

Brace yourself for the worst. Your friend might reject you, and you might feel heartbroken. Recognize that this might happen. Everybody goes through heartbreak at some point in their life, and it’s really hard, but over time you get over it. Before you ask your guy friend out, tell a different trusted friend about the brave thing you’re about to do. That way, if it goes poorly, your other friend can come over and comfort you with a big hug and lots of encouragement, instead of you sitting alone.[6]\n\nIt will feel less scary if you know your other friend is rooting for you, and is just a phone call away.\nThis way you’ll have somebody to celebrate with if it goes well, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nAsking Him Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAcknowledge that what you’re about to say might be surprising. Telling him this prepares him a little bit emotionally for what you’re about to say, so he isn’t shocked. It also acknowledges that you are thinking about and anticipating his feelings, so he won’t feel guilty if he shows surprise.[7]\nSay, “I realize this might be surprising but I just wanted to let you know how I’ve been feeling lately.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nAsk him out clearly, but casually. Be clear that you like him as more than a friend but you don’t profess your undying love. That would be startling if he never thought about you like that before.[8]\n\nSay something like, “Lately I’ve been feeling like I like you as more than a friend. I was wondering if you might want to go on a date sometime?”\nAvoid asking, “Do you like me back?” or “Will you be my boyfriend?” because he might not have developed feelings for you yet, but he might be open to exploring the possibility by going on a date with you.\nIt’s very important to be clear and use scary words like “date” because otherwise he might not get that you’re asking him out.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMake your feelings seem recent. If he says yes, and you start a relationship, you can tell him the truth later about how long you liked him, if it's been a long time. Otherwise, it’s best to keep it a secret to help make your friendship feel less awkward. [10]\n\nEven if you’ve been pining for your friend for months or years, say, “Recently I’ve been feeling…” or “Lately I’ve been feeling…” so that he doesn’t freak out.\nThis takes the pressure off, and isn’t really lying, because “lately” and “recently” could be defined in many ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe clear that the friendship is your top priority. Make it clear that you weren’t just friends with your guy friend because you wanted to get with him. Your guy friend will feel comforted knowing that he won’t lose your friendship, no matter if he wants to go out with you or not.[11]\nSay, “Our friendship is my top priority, so if you don’t want to go out, I understand, and I don’t want this to mess up our friendship.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/72/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nRespect his answer. Real life isn’t like a rom-com where you can convince someone to love you by talking them into it. Instead, you should respect his feelings. If he says no, don’t try to talk him around. Imagine how you’d feel if somebody you rejected kept pestering you to change your mind. [12]\nTry to remember that a rejection doesn’t say anything about your value as a person, or your chances of finding love in the long term. It just means that this one guy likes you as a friend, and not as a crush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid36202-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Guy-Friend-You-Like-Him-More-Than-As-a-Friend-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nExpect changes in your friendship.

If he says no, you’ll both have some “fake-it-till-you-make-it” to do, pretending things aren’t awkward, until, eventually, they’ll stop feeling awkward.[13]\n\nThough you might be feeling embarrassed or heartbroken now, it is possible to keep a friendship after a rejection. You may have to give yourself some time and space to heal, but with time you can get over the rejection, fall for someone else, and still keep this friendship in your life.\nIf you two decide to start dating, you should have a conversation sometime soon about how this will affect hanging out with mutual friends, and other aspects of your friendship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Tell-Your-Best-Friend-That-You-Are-in-Love-With-the-Same-Guy","title":"How to Tell Your Best Friend That You Are in Love With the Same Guy","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nAre you sure you're in love with him too?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell Your Best Friend That You Are in Love With the Same Guy Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Tell-Your-Best-Friend-That-You-Are-in-Love-With-the-Same-Guy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid1025678-v4-728px-Tell-Your-Best-Friend-That-You-Are-in-Love-With-the-Same-Guy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nConsider what it is about the guy that makes you think you're also falling for him.

There are a number of different body language cues for attraction, and when you notice your best friend displaying them consistently it can signal that they're attracted to you. Look for signs like:[5]\n\nThey maintain eye contact and gaze at you.\nThey smile subconsciously while they're talking about you.\nThey try to be physically close to you by initiating physical contact.\nWhen you talk, their feet are pointed towards you.\nThey mirror your body language when you two are speaking.\nThey touch their hair and face while you're talking.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Attract a Guy Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Attract-a-Guy-Step-3.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Attract-a-Guy-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"455\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nNotice increased physical contact. When someone is interested in you, they will try to initiate physical contact more frequently. The two of you might go from not hugging frequently to hugging every time you see each other.[7]\nThe type of physical contact that you have may start to be different as well. Rather than punching you on the arm affectionately, they may initiate a hug. Or, they may start to touch your knee or your arm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/64/Kiss-a-Boy-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nNotice when they initiate physical contact. Physical contact between friends is normal and healthy, but you may start to notice that they are initiating contact much more frequently than they normally do. They may try to be physically affectionate by hugging you, putting their arm around your shoulder, or touching your hand.[8]\n\nThey may try to “accidentally” brush against you when the two of you are close. This could mean that they are nervous to initiate other kinds of physical contact, like a hug, but they want to be near to you.\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the amount of physical contact, you should let them know in a gentle and kind way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nAssessing Your Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Kiss a Boy for the First Time Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/17/Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Kiss-a-Boy-for-the-First-Time-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nDetermine how you feel. Are you romantically interested in your best friend?  Ask yourself whether you would be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with this person if they did like you. How you feel about them as a romantic partner will influence your reactions towards their behavior.[9]\n\nIf you are interested in them romantically, try to be honest with them about how you are feeling. If the signs are there, they might be interested in you as well. You could try to hint that you have a crush on someone to see how they react, or ask them if they are interested in anyone.\nFor example, you could say \"Jen, I've been thinking about our friendship a lot, and I think we could be really great together as more than friends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get a Boy in Middle School to Like You Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/96/Get-a-Boy-in-Middle-School-to-Like-You-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Get-a-Boy-in-Middle-School-to-Like-You-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLook at how you're acting. You may be giving them signals that you are interested in them without you realizing it. For example, you could be flirting with them, being more physically affectionate, or opening up more to them emotionally. If you are not interested in your friend as a romantic partner, you should try to stop these overly affectionate behaviors, since they could be giving them mixed signals.\nIf you are interested in them, you can continue giving them signs that you are interested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Start a Conversation When You Have Nothing to Talk About Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1d/Start-a-Conversation-When-You-Have-Nothing-to-Talk-About-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Start-a-Conversation-When-You-Have-Nothing-to-Talk-About-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nTalk to your friends. You may still be confused about whether your best friend really does like you in a romantic way. You can talk to a close friend to ask their opinion and to see whether they know if your friend has a crush on anyone.\n\nDo this carefully, you don't want word to get back to your best friend that you're talking about them behind their back. Only talk to friends that you really trust and who have a good perspective on the situation.\nYou could also casually talk to one of their friends to see if they know whether your best friend is interested in someone. You could say something like, \"Hey, I noticed that Zach hasn't been talking about Caroline anymore. Do you know if he's interested in someone new?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell a Guy You Like Him Step 7Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/51/Tell-a-Guy-You-Like-Him-Step-7Bullet1.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Tell-a-Guy-You-Like-Him-Step-7Bullet1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTalk to them. If you're still not sure, just ask. This is the only reliable way to figure out if they are interested in you romantically, but it can come with some risks. For one, the person might not want to jeopardize the friendship, and so will feel uncomfortable telling you.\n\nBe sure you want the relationship to move onto a romance before asking. If you don't, it's better to just avoid the question and let the feelings slowly pass. If the best friend suddenly makes a move or comes out and tells you, then you can address it.\nIf you want to ask, say something like, \"I don't want to weird you out, but I've noticed things changing a little between us lately, and wondered if it's because our relationship has shifted a little bit.\" This will give them an opportunity to share their feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Tell a Girl You Love Her when You Are Not Sure She Loves You Back Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/94/Tell-a-Girl-You-Love-Her-when-You-Are-Not-Sure-She-Loves-You-Back-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Tell-a-Girl-You-Love-Her-when-You-Are-Not-Sure-She-Loves-You-Back-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nApproach the topic carefully. If your friend doesn't open up, or says something dismissive like,  \"No way, what, are you crazy?  We're friends, that's all\", you should let it go.  You can diffuse the situation by saying something like, \"Hey, no problem, I was just curious.  It's cool, either way.\"\nIf your friend is scared to tell you, or is wrestling with their feelings, it may take some time for them to come clean about it to you.  Be patient and compassionate, and don't pressure your friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get a Girl to Fall in Love with You Step 26\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Get-a-Girl-to-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-26-Version-3.jpg/aid162834-v4-728px-Get-a-Girl-to-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-26-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTell them how much you value their friendship. Let them know that your friendship is important to you and that you care about them as a person. Whether you and your best friend end up together or not, your friendship is special and you don't want to lose them.\n\nIf they are interested in you romantically, and you don't share the same feelings for them, they may need to take a break from your friendship. This will hurt, but they need time to process their own feelings and move on.\nTell them that you do care about your relationship by saying, \"Ben, your friendship means a lot to me. You're a great friend and I'm glad that I have you in my life. I don't have romantic feelings for you, but I hope that we can still be best friends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Good-Friends-With-a-Girl-%28Guys%29","title":"How to Be Good Friends With a Girl (Guys)","content":["\n\nMethod 1\n\nBecoming Better Friends With A Girl You Know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have a Great Day with Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e9/Have-a-Great-Day-with-Your-Boyfriend-or-Girlfriend-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Have-a-Great-Day-with-Your-Boyfriend-or-Girlfriend-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nFind common interests and do them together. Sharing activities with the girl will improve your relationship with her.[1] When you have a good time with a girl, she is more likely to remember the experience. Friendships are typically started because two people share a common interest, so it's important that you both share one before becoming better friends. \n\nOne way to avoid sending mixed signals is to tell the girl how much the activity costs. By doing this you are setting the tempo for a friendly hang-out and not a date.\nYou can go to a restaurant to eat, travel to an amusement park, attend another friend's birthday party, go surfing, join an art class, or do anything else that you both like.\nHanging out inside and watching movies is always an option if there isn't anything to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Keep Your Girlfriend Interested in You Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fe/Keep-Your-Girlfriend-Interested-in-You-Step-1.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Keep-Your-Girlfriend-Interested-in-You-Step-1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nHave genuine and vulnerable conversations. As humans we bond over conversation, especially if the topic of conversation is something that we hold emotionally dear.[2] The more you have conversations about each other's lives, the more connected you will feel. Being vulnerable means listening to her fears and emotions and being open to talk about yours. \n\nDon't be critical of her if she comes to you with a problem. The last thing a girl wants to hear is how she did wrong when she already knows she messed up.\nAlways listen for the girl's perspective and see where she is coming from before giving your advice.\nAsking a girl for advice will open up trust, and she will become more likely to seek you out for her own advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get Your Ex to Fall for You Again Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Get-Your-Ex-to-Fall-for-You-Again-Step-16.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-Your-Ex-to-Fall-for-You-Again-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nCompliment her in a non-sexual way. Getting compliments makes us feel good and motivates us to do things.[3] You should always compliment a girl when you admire something she has accomplished or achieved. However, you shouldn't compliment a girl when it comes to her looks, because it can put her in an uncomfortable place if you're just friends. Instead, take cues from the compliments that she gives to you. If she never mentions your physical appearance, it's best to not mention her looks. \nRefrain from saying things like “you're so beautiful,” or other general things about her appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nKeeping Your Friendships Strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get a Guy to Admit That He Likes You Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nKeep in contact with her. As time goes on it can be harder to maintain strong relationships with a girl, so you might have to put in a more concerted effort to text or call her. If you still live close to one another, make sure you keep her in mind for social events and gatherings. Remembering a friend's birthday is also another great reason to reach out to her or give her a visit. \n\nIf your friend moves to another state, try staying active with her on social media.\nIf your friend is busy, go to her. Make it convenient for her if you have the extra time. She will appreciate it down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Attract a Boy Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Attract-a-Boy-Step-9.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Attract-a-Boy-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGo out with her if she invites you to something. The more you accept social invitations, the more likely girls will invite you to future events. This is especially important if the girl is attending an event she doesn't want to go to, and needs a friend to support her. \n\nIf you are busy or have something else to do and can't attend, make sure to tell your friend far enough in advance so she can find someone else to go with.\nIf you don't want to go to something, don't go. Your negative energy will probably make interactions between you and her worse than she would normally be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Break Up with Someone Without Giving Any Reasons Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Break-Up-with-Someone-Without-Giving-Any-Reasons-Step-4.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Break-Up-with-Someone-Without-Giving-Any-Reasons-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe the emotional support she needs. Many people go through different ups and downs, and most people need friends to act as emotional support during the rough times.[4]\n\nBeing a good friend also means knowing when to back off and allow someone to grieve. Make sure not to be overbearing.\nEmotional support is also necessary for stressful but happy times, like before a performance or sporting event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get Your Ex to Fall for You Again Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Get-Your-Ex-to-Fall-for-You-Again-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-Your-Ex-to-Fall-for-You-Again-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nRefrain from being sexual or romantic unless that's what she wants. One of the easiest ways to destroy a friendship with the opposite sex is to be overtly sexual or romantic when it is not wanted. Not only does it make the girl feel uncomfortable, it might actually also make her sad because she cares about you as a friend, but not in a romantic way. A friendship can eventually blossom into a romantic relationship, but it only occurs when both people want it. \n\nIf you develop romantic feelings for your friend, you should tell her. Be wary however, it may hurt your friendship in the long run.\nIf your friend wants to be romantic with you, and you are okay with that, go for it. The best relationships are built off friendships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nMeeting New Girls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get Rid of a Friend Who Is Not Trustworthy Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cb/Get-Rid-of-a-Friend-Who-Is-Not-Trustworthy-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-a-Friend-Who-Is-Not-Trustworthy-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAttend social gatherings that girls are going to. Try to attend social gatherings where there are girls that you'd want to be friends with. Be on the lookout for popular events going on in your city or town, and be ready to go to her. If you can, try taking a course that interests you like a community art class, or join an intramural sports club. Meeting new people is easy, you just need to put yourself in a situation that allows you to be around them.\n\nIf there is a limited opportunity to be social, try to get creative. You can meet girls at the grocery store, your place of worship, the gym, or at a shopping mall.\nIf you are in school you have the perfect opportunity to meet new girls from your class. Go up to her before or after the class starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get a Guy to Admit That He Likes You Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nIntroduce yourself to girls who you'd want to be friends with. Tell the girl your name, and ask her what her name is. Start small-talk by talking about what you are both doing, or where you both are at the time.\n\nIf you are anxious about approaching new people, the only way to feel less nervous is to just do it. The worst thing that can happen is that she might not want to talk to you.\nGood questions include, “this place is really fun, do you like it?” or “that lecture was really boring, what do you think of the class?”\nTry coming off as confident but not pushy. Just talk to the girl as if you were talking to a good male friend, but more polite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get a Guy to Admit That He Likes You Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2d/Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-a-Guy-to-Admit-That-He-Likes-You-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nDetermine what you share in common and talk about it. There's a good chance that the girl you want to be friends with shares something in common with you, because you are both at the same social gathering. For instance, if you are meeting girls at a sports club, you'll most likely share an interest in sports or if you're at an art class an interest in art, etc. Try to find a common bond, and something you are knowledgeable about and that you like to talk about.\n\nTry to be funny and lighthearted when you are talking to a girl. If you can make her laugh, it'll be more likely she will want to be your friend.[5]\n\nBe a good listener and let her talk. The more you ask questions, the more she will open up and feel comfortable. You should be responding and stating your opinion, but you should also be concentrated on being a good listener.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Cell Phone Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/27/Buy-a-Cell-Phone-Step-5.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Buy-a-Cell-Phone-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nGet her contact information. Once you feel like you and the girl you've met have had a good conversation, make sure to get her cell-phone number. Don't be afraid of asking her for it, especially if the conversation went well. Tell her that you had fun talking, and ask her if she wants to talk again. If she does, then get her information. \n\nIf the conversation went poorly, there's a good chance she won't want to give you her number.\nIf you're unsure of when you are leaving, you can even ask before the conversation ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get off the Phone Quickly Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4c/Get-off-the-Phone-Quickly-Step-21.jpg/aid1856617-v4-728px-Get-off-the-Phone-Quickly-Step-21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nText her to hang out. Determine something that you can both do, and ask her if she wants to meet up with you. This could be lunch, rock climbing, or going to see a band. If you're having problems about thinking of something to do, try to remember what you've talked about previously, and choose something that interests you both. Don't make the hang out romantic and don't flirt in your texts or you might send off the wrong signals. You can even go as far as to tell her that you're not looking to date right now.\n\nDon't text her too many times if she isn't responding. She may be busy or may just not want to talk. You don't want to look desperate for friends, and you also don't want to make her angry or annoyed.\nFunny or interesting images are also good things you can share via text.\nTry to be as nice as possible in your texts. Since she can't hear your voice intonation, you don't want to be sarcastic because she may take it literally.[6]\n\nIf the girl is texting you a lot, then you should text back.

You do not want to tell him right before a big football game or exam. Instead, wait for a weekend afternoon when neither you nor your friend have big plans or obligations.\nAs it's just going to be you and your friend, pick a place that does not look like a date. Going out to lunch together may feel date-like, so choose something more low-key. What do you and your friend normally do together? Maybe you like to hang out in the park.

It can be difficult to tell your friend you're not interested in him. In the moment, you may feel nervous. Therefore, try to write down your thoughts ahead of time. This will help you get a sense of how you feel, and figure out the best way to express that.[2]\n\nGet a pen or pencil and paper and jot down your thoughts. How do you feel? What is the best way to express this?\nFrom there, write down what you want from the conversation. Do you want you and your friend to work on salvaging the friendship? Do you need some space from this friend so he can sort out his feelings?\nYou should not read out what you're writing word-per-word during the discussion. This is more of a way to get your thoughts out. By writing out your thoughts ahead of time, you can better express them in the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Dump Your Boyfriend Nicely Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-6.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nFeel some empathy for your friend. You want to try and get a sense of what your friend is feeling going into the conversation. Empathy is important at any point, but is vital to difficult conversations. Your friend may react negatively to the news, and you want to understand why so you do not become frustrated.[3]\n\nTry to think how you would feel in your friend's position. Imagine having feelings for someone, and thinking that person may feel the same way. It would be crushing to hear the truth. Your friend will likely feel sad and disappointed, and worried about the harm done to your friendship.\nCarry this empathy into the conversation. While talking to your friend, he may react poorly. He may become upset, or even angry. Try to remember your friend is going through something difficult. Remember what it's like to be in his shoes in the moment, and you'll be better equipped to cope with a negative reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Stop Wheezing Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7a/Stop-Wheezing-Step-14.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Stop-Wheezing-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nRemain open-minded. If you go into the conversation with assumptions, this may change how you act. For example, if you expect your friend to get mad, you may go into the conversation with hostility. Conversely, if you think your friend will shake it off easily, you may come off as uncaring.[4]\n\nRemind yourself of what you don't know. You cannot know how a situation is going to unfold until it's occurring. Therefore, it makes no sense to make predictions.\nGo into the situation calm and optimistic, but with no assumptions on how your friend will react. By keeping your expectations open, you'll find it easier to deal with a range of potential reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nDiscussing Your Feelings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With a Jealous Person Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/42/Deal-With-a-Jealous-Person-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Jealous-Person-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nBe honest about how you feel. You want to make sure your friend understand you do not want a romantic relationship. You do not want to give a soft answer, that gives your friend hope that you'll change your mind in the future. You should be as honest as possible about how you're feeling.[5][6]\n\nExplain your feelings up front. You can begin the discussion with something like, \"I know you have feelings for me, but I don't have any romantic feelings for you.\"\nIt can help to explain the reasons for your feelings, as this can give your friend closure. However, remember that being honest does not mean being brutal.\nIf you want to give a reason, be tactful. Maybe you're just not attracted to your friend. Do not say, \"You're a little too short, and that's not my type physically, so I don't think it would work.\" You don't want to sound like you're tearing your friend apart. Instead, try something like, \"I just don't feel a physical spark between us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With a Jealous Person Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Deal-With-a-Jealous-Person-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Jealous-Person-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake it clear you want to maintain only a friendship. A lot of times, saying, \"Let's still be friends\" can be misinterpreted. People may take this as a sign you may change your mind. Your friend may think you will eventually develop romantic feelings for him. Make it clear you want to continue the friendship, but without the hope of a romantic relationship.[7][8]\n\nEmphasize you value the friendship. Say something like, \"You are one of my best guy friends, though, and that's really important to me.\"\nHonesty is important when you make it clear you want to stay friends. Don't leave it at, \"Let's stay friends.\" Make it clear you only want friendship. Say something like, \"I want us to stay good friends, but I just want to be clear I don't see a romantic relationship developing between us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Dump Your Boyfriend Nicely Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nListen to how your friend responds. Your friend may very well be upset or hurt by the conversation. That's understandable. Being rejected romantically hurts. You should listen to your friend's response. Allow him to express himself, just as you did.[9]\n\nYour friend may be disappointed and upset. This is understandable. Try to be empathetic as you listen. Remind him that you do still value the friendship.\nYour friend may also have some questions for you, regarding your feelings. If you choose to answer the questions, do so honestly, but without being brutal. If he asks why you're not attracted to him, say, \"I'm just not\" rather than diving into specifics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nMoving Forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Dump Your Boyfriend Nicely Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-12.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Dump-Your-Boyfriend-Nicely-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAllow for some space. It can be very hard to return to a normal friendship after letting someone down. In the aftermath of your conversation, you and your friend may both need some space.[10]\n\nYou can try setting basic boundaries. For example, you could agree to just see each other at school for a set number of weeks.\nHowever, you may want to have looser boundaries. You could, for example, agree to lessen up on contact, but with no specific rules how. You may find one-on-one hang outs, texting, and calling slow down, but that you still see your friend out in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Carry on a Romantic Conversation Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Carry-on-a-Romantic-Conversation-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Carry-on-a-Romantic-Conversation-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nShow your friend you appreciate him. A good way to make sure a friendship stays strong over time is showing basic love and appreciation. Even though a romantic relationship is out of the question, find ways to show your friend you appreciate him. This will make it clear you value your friend's role in your life, even if you do not want a romantic relationship.[11]\n\nMake sure to genuinely listen to your friend. Show interest in his passions, troubles, successes, and failures. Ask him, for example, how debate team is going. Wish him good luck, or make him a small card, going into a big competition.\nHowever, you may want to hold off on gestures of appreciation for a bit after your talk. You do not want them to be mistaken for romantic interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gentle Person Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b8/Be-a-Gentle-Person-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Be-a-Gentle-Person-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nRespect your friend's feelings. Being friends with someone who is romantically interested in you can be confusing. Even if you've made it clear that you only want a friendship, your friend may be harboring some hope things will change. Be aware there may be different expectations so you can navigate them accordingly.[12]\n\nMake sure you understand there is no right or wrong when it comes to expectations or wants. Your friend may continue to want a romantic relationship with you, and he cannot turn off how he feels.\nHowever, you cannot change how you feel either. This is equally important to remember. You should not feel guilty if you do not return your friend's feelings, nor should anyone make you feel bad about your feelings. It's always okay to feel what you're feeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Talk to Strangers Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/74/Talk-to-Strangers-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/aid677287-v4-728px-Talk-to-Strangers-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nKeep communication open. Going forward, keep talking to your friend regularly. If your friend's feelings do not go away, you may have to have a conversation again in the future. Make sure you and your friend keep communication open between the two of you.[13]\n\nUncomfortable situations can occur if your friend remains romantically invested in you. Feelings of anger and resentment may build, especially if you start dating someone else.\nIt's important to avoid building resentment. Let your friend know that he can still tell you anything, even if you're just friends. If he's feeling angry or frustrated with you, let him know he should not hold it in.\nIf you're able to keep talking, and navigating awkward or frustrating situations, you and your friend can salvage the friendship despite this setback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ADating-and-Friends","title":"Category: Dating and Friends","content":[]}]
