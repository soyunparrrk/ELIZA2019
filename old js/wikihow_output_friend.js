Notice how they act and talk around your crush to tell whether or not your friend is interested. Tell your friend who you like when you start to develop feelings or ask your friend directly who they like if you’re concerned. Remember that ultimately you cannot control how other people feel, whether it’s your best friend or your crush. By being open, honest, and direct, you can try to avoid any hard feelings.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Looking for Signs","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nNotice if your friend tries to get your crush's attention. When you’re in a group, your friend may wait for your crush to respond after they tell a story, ask a question, or make a comment. If this is the case, there’s a good chance your friend likes your crush too.[1]\nFor example, your friend BFF may ask your crush a question about their weekend.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nWatch to see if your friend tilts their body toward your crush. When you like someone, you may naturally direct your body toward them. When you’re around both your friend and your crush, notice if your friend points their knees, feet, shoulders, or head in the direction of your crush.[2]\nIf your friend angles their chair toward your crush’s seat, this is another indication that they might like the person.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nMake a note if your friend tries to touch your crush. If your friend lightly touches your crush’s arm, gently rubs your crush's hand, or puts their hand on your crush's back, they may be flirting. If this is the case, your friend may like your crush too.[3]\nFor instance, your friend may touch your crush’s shoulder as they say goodbye.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nPay attention if your friend is nervous or awkward around your crush. When you like someone, you often get anxious since you want to make a good impression. If your friend starts to trip over their words or act quiet and reserved in the presence of your crush, they may have feelings for them.[4]\n\nFor instance, your friend may stutter slightly or look back and forth toward your crush repetitively.\nIf your friend is shy in general, this may not indicate that they have romantic feelings.\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nObserve any flirty behavior to tell if your friend likes your crush. If your friend does things like make eye contact with your crush, flip their hair, smile when your crush is around, or laugh and giggle often, they are likely flirting with your crush. While some laughing and joking can be completely harmless, if they do these things all the time, your friend is likely crushing too.[5]\nAlso pay attention to see if your crush does any of these things toward your friend. If so, they may like your friend too.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nTalk about your crush to your friend and see how they respond. To get a sense of how your best friend feels, mention your crush to them in conversation. Do this casually so they don’t think you’re prying for information. For example, mention that you want to invite your crush to prom.\nYou can also say something like, “So I was hanging out with Brian in between classes. He’s really funny,” to see what they say. If your friend is not interested, they may not make a comment. If they are crushing on them too, they may express interest once you bring them up.\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Chatting with Your Best Friend","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nTell your friend who you’re crushing on when you develop feelings. Do this when you know you like someone to prevent competition down the line. If you keep your feelings to yourself, your friend may never know how you feel.[6]\nIf you don’t inform your friend how you feel, it’s unfair to be upset if they start to like your crush too.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nAsk your friend who they're crushing on. To eliminate complications and get to the point, simply ask your friend directly who they like. You can do this after you’ve noticed your friend’s flirty or suggestive behavior. Or, do this as you mention your crush to see how they respond. This way, you are both honest and open about your feelings.[7]\n\nFor example, you can say something like, “I think I’m going to ask Heidi out to prom. Do you know who you’re asking yet?”\nFor example, your friend may mention that they’ve thought about your crush romantically but haven’t pursued it, that they have no feelings or your crush, or that your crush has expressed interested in them.\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nBring up your concerns with your friend. If your friend tells you that they like your crush, explain to them that you like them too. This situation may be a bit awkward and uncomfortable, but the best thing to do is to be truthful and direct about your feelings.[8]\nFor instance, tell your friend how long you’ve liked your crush and how strong your feelings are. They may back off if they are interested in other people.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nDecide whether your crush is worth losing a friendship over. Once you disclose your feelings, your friend may let you go after your crush, or they may get upset and defensive. At this point, choose if it’s worth it to lose your best friend. If you value your friendship more than the potential with your crush, explain that to your friend and go from there.[9]\nIf you’d rather go after your crush, know that you and your best friend may not be friends any longer.\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Responding If Your Crush Likes Your Friend","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nAccept the situation for what it is and move on. If you chat about the situation with your friend and they explain that your crush likes them, sadly there may not be much you can do about it. Try not to take the situation personally, and understand that you cannot control how people feel. At this point, it’s best to look for other fish in the sea.[10]\n\nYou may also find out your crush likes your friend after you ask them out.\nRather than asking yourself what you did wrong or why your crush doesn’t like you, try to let the situation go. This may be easier said than done, but try your best and you’ll feel better over time.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nBe honest with your crush and your friend. Since this situation is a bit emotional and awkward, try to communicate with both your best friend and your crush. Explain to them how you feel, and whether you’re sad, depressed, jealous, hurt, or angry. The situation is easier to deal with immediately than if you try to push it away.[11]\n\nWhile explaining how you feel may not change the situation, you’ll feel better after expressing your emotions.\nFor instance, say to your friend, “I feel very hurt that you took them from behind my back.”\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nFocus on boosting your self-esteem and making yourself happy. You may feel upset or hurt for a bit, and that’s perfectly okay. Do what you can to boost your mood and take care of yourself. Read a book to get them off your mind, treat yourself to a spa day at home, or start a new hobby, for example.[12]\nIf you have to distance yourself from your crush and your friend, do what makes you feel better. You don’t have to hang out with them if you don’t want to.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nHang out with your other friends for a positive distraction. To keep your mind off your best friend and your crush, spend time with people that make you feel good. This can be other close friends, new acquaintances, or a new love interest.

If you’re trying to tell if your best guy friend likes you, try looking for signs of affection or changes in your relationship that might be an indication of his feelings.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Spotting Signs of Affection","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nWatch for bashfulness. In romantic movies, male leads are often men of fiery passion and debonair confidence. In real life, guys are often shy, nervous, and self-doubting - just like everyone else! If you suspect your guy friend has a crush on you, looking for the tell-tale signs and bashful shyness would be a great place to start. Does your friend seem ever-so-slightly nervous in your company? Does his laugh seem forced or unnatural? Does he seem to make an effort to perpetually laugh and smile around you, even when nothing particularly amusing is happening? These are signs that your friend is worried about what you think about him![1]\nHere are a few other things to look for:\n\nBlushing\nSlight awkwardness in conversation\nA slight reluctance or hesitation when saying \"goodbye\"\n\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nLook for suspicious eye contact. People with hardcore crushes have a hard time taking their eyes off of the person their heart is set on. Does your guy friend seem to look you in the eyes more than normal conversation requires? Does he always smile when he sees you looking back? The eyes are said to be the window to the soul - even if your guy friend is too shy to admit his affection, his eyes may give away everything.[2]\nPeople who can't take their eyes off of their crush usually realize it just an instant too late. If you catch your guy friend staring at you and he seems embarrassed or pretends to look away, you may have just caught him in a moment of heartfelt longing!\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nLook for adoring body language. A hidden crush can often have a noticeable effect on a guy's thoughts and behavior, subtly and unconsciously changing the way he uses his body. Does your guy friend's body language seem to imply that he's giving you his full, complete attention, whether the situation calls for it or not? In other words, does he make a point to turn and face you when he speaks to you? Does he seem to \"straighten up\" when he notices you? Does he draw his shoulders back or use an arm to prop himself up on a nearby wall when he talks to you? This body language may be betraying secret feelings of affection.[3]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nTake note of \"accidental\" touching. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book! Many guys with crushes will pounce on any chance to touch the girl of their affections.[4] They'll be extra-generous with hugs, they'll always be the person to hand you something you can't reach, they'll \"accidentally\" bump into you while walking, and so on. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be a little more \"touchy\" than usual, you can be fairly certain he has feelings he's not letting on.\nSometimes, smitten guys will actually go as far as to contrive situations where they'll have to touch you. If your guy friend, for instance, seems to become extra clumsy around you and develop a habit of dropping things, pay attention to what happens when you pick them up and hand them to him - does he subtly brush your hand?\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nSee whether he makes an effort to be either around you or away from you. Guy friends who secretly adore their female friend usually want to be around her as much as they can. Most of the time, guy friends harboring a secret crush will (consciously or not) gravitate towards her - standing next to her at social occasions, sitting next to her at meals, etc. Sometimes, however, a guy can be especially shy. In this case, even though he longs for his friend, her presence makes him so nervous that he'll actually find ways not to be next to her. Subtly pay attention to your guy friend's habits - if he seems to end up either right next to you or far away from you whenever you hang out in a group of people, you'll know something is up.\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Analyzing Your Relationship","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nSee whether he makes hanging out a special priority. If your guy friend likes you, hanging out with you will become one of his favorite things to do. He'll want to hang out with you as much as he can and will sometimes even cancel his other plans to be able to do so. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be contacting you to see what you're up to and find out whether you're busy every day, you may be dealing with a lovesick guy pal.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nPay attention to the things you talk about together. Guys with big crushes on their lady friends will sometimes very subtly allude to their feelings in conversation. They do this in a number of ways. Some try to steer the conversation toward romantic topics, asking questions about who their female friend likes and whether she's looking for someone. Others will want to talk about the practice of dating itself, for instance, joking about how ridiculous most couples seem to be. Keep track of the types of conversations you have with your guy friend - if they mostly seem to be about romance or dating, even if he makes no indication that he's interested in dating you specifically, this may be his way of signalling his interest.\nThere's an obvious exception to this rule. If your guy friend involves you in his love life by asking you for advice with other girls, it's usually a sign that he thinks of you as a non-romantic friend.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nLook out for flirting. Some guys are less shy than others. Especially confident guys may even enjoy openly flirting with you. If your guy friend has developed a habit of playfully teasing you, making silly innuendos, or seems to enjoy scandalizing you, this shows that, at the very least, he's thought about you as more than a friend.\nRealize that a guy's intentions can be somewhat vague when he flirts. Many guys have a habit of flirting, then playing their flirtation off as a joke if their advances aren't immediately reciprocated. Still others flat out use flirtation and innuendo as a form of goofing off. Persistent, repeated flirtation, however, is almost always a sign of something more.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nKnow a \"fake date\" when it happens. Guys who wish they were dating their gal friend sometimes recreate the atmosphere of a date when they're hanging out with her. Keep an eye out for this - when you meet your guy friend for a friendly meal, does he seem a little more \"formal\" than usual? For instance, if he's normally vulgar and loud-mouthed, does he become quieter and more reserved? Does he develop good manners out of nowhere? Does he insist on paying for you? If so, your guy friend may be taking you on a \"fake date\" in an attempt to make the real thing a possibility.\nAlso, pay attention to where he takes you and how he dresses. If he takes you to fancier, \"nicer\" places than you'd normally go to while hanging out and he \"cleans up\" his appearance, you'll know you're on a fake date.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nNote how he treats other girls. This is one of the most important things to look for when trying to figure out whether a guy friend is into you, but it's something that's often overlooked. If you think your guy friend is being especially affectionate with you, before jumping to conclusions, pay attention to the way he interacts with other girls. If he acts the same way around other girls that he does around you, you may be dealing with natural flirt or extrovert, rather than a secret admirer.\nListen when your guy friend talks to you about other girls. As noted above, if he openly asks you for advice on how to attract and win over other girls, he probably doesn't see you as anything more than a friend. However, if he seems unsatisfied with other girls, complaining about how he just can't seem to find the right person, this may be his way of hinting that he's interested in you.\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Asking Others","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nAsk friends. Finding out whether your guy friend likes you or not doesn't have to be guesswork - one great way to cut right to the heart of the matter is to simply ask someone who's close to him! Most groups of guy friends talk about their crushes with each other. If your guy friend has a crush on you, there's a good chance that one or more of his friends know about it.\nIf you can, you may want to find a mutual friend - someone who's close to both you and your guy friend. Not only can this person give you helpful advice and help you plan your next steps, but, since s/he is (hopefully) loyal to you, s/he's less likely to let your secret slip.\nOn the other hand, asking someone who's friends with your guy friend and not with you can be riskier. There's a good chance with this option that the person you ask will tell your guy friend that you asked about him. This can work in your favor if you want your guy friend to know that you're also interested in him, but, if you don't, it can backfire.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nAsk your guy friend! If you're really confident, the simplest, most direct way to figure out if he likes you is just to ask him to his face. This can be awfully nerve-wracking, but, usually, the temporary stress of speaking openly about your feelings is worth the closure of knowing for sure whether your guy friend likes you or not. When you ask your guy friend whether he likes you, be sure that you're in a private place, as most guys will be too shy to talk about their feelings in front of other people.\nSome guys, unfortunately, are also too shy to talk about their feelings in front of you. If you ask your guy friend directly whether he likes you or not and he says no, but he keeps flirting with you and being affectionate, you may have encountered a guy who's too shy to admit his true feelings to anyone. There's not much you can do in this case. Simply live your life and do what you want to do and eventually, this guy either will or won't gain some confidence.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nIf it turns out that you both like each other, ask him out! If you find out that your guy friend likes you from one of his friends or from your guy friend himself and you know that you like him back, you have no reason not to ask him out. This will probably naturally happen anyway once you both know that you like each other. Enjoy your first date - since you're already friends, you'll be able to skip the awkward small talk and enjoy your time together as a new couple!\nIn our society, there's an unspoken stereotype that guys are supposed to ask girls out and not vice versa. If your guy friend likes you but is too shy to ask you out, don't be afraid to completely ignore this outdated tradition! There's no reason that you should wait to be happy until you're asked out in the \"proper\" way, especially when the \"proper\" way is a relic of an earlier, more formal time.[5]\n\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Falling-in-Love-with-Your-Best-Friend-%28for-Guys%29","title":"How to Deal With Falling in Love with Your Best Friend (for Guys)","content":{"intro":"Updated: November 4, 2019\n\tExplore this Article\n\t\tFinding out How They Feel\n\t\tTelling Them How You Feel\n\t\tMoving Forward\n\t\tAsk a Question\n\t\tRelated Articles\nDealing with falling in love with your best friend can feel difficult and you may be worried that you’ll ruin your friendship.

You should find out if he’s gay or straight or bi, to see if you have a chance, depending on your gender.[1]\nIf you’re really crushing on your friend who’s in a relationship, or isn’t into people who are your gender, try dating other people to take your mind off it.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nWrite down in advance what you want to say.

If you feel comfortable, practice it in front of a friend. Your friend can give you feedback on how you sound, and if you should rephrase anything.[3]\nRemember, it’s okay if you look a bit nervous. Everybody knows that asking out a friend is nerve-wracking. Just focus on sounding clear and fairly casual.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nTell your crush that you want to talk to him in private. If your crush is single, then it’s time for you to be brave and ask him.

It’s also best to have this conversation in private, because you’re about to be really vulnerable.[4]\n\nIf he says yes, having the conversation in private would pay off in case you two want to start kissing.\nIf you’re really too shy to ask him out in person, then you can ask him out over text.\nYou can text him something like, “Can you meet after school in the park? I have something I need to talk about with you,” or, “I need to talk with you about something.

Maybe the timing isn’t right, or he’s interested in someone else, or he has a lot on his mind right now.[5]\n\nGiving yourself a pep-talk will boost your self-confidence and prepare you for the conversation.\nTell yourself something like, “I am a kind, creative person and he would be lucky to date me.” Remind yourself of your qualities that you are most proud of, like your bravery, honesty, work ethic, or joy-de-vivre.

Before you ask your guy friend out, tell a different trusted friend about the brave thing you’re about to do. That way, if it goes poorly, your other friend can come over and comfort you with a big hug and lots of encouragement, instead of you sitting alone.[6]\n\nIt will feel less scary if you know your other friend is rooting for you, and is just a phone call away.\nThis way you’ll have somebody to celebrate with if it goes well, too.\n\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Asking Him Out","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nAcknowledge that what you’re about to say might be surprising.

Soon, you discover he's developed romantic feelings for you, which are not reciprocated. It can be hard to let someone down romantically, especially someone you consider a good friend. However, as this person is your friend, you'll need to be upfront with him right away. Plan a sit down talk with him to discuss your relationship. Be honest with him. Tell him you care for him very much as a friend, but are not interested in a romantic relationship. You may need to give him some time to move on. It may be awhile before your friendship returns to normal.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Planning A Talk","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nChoose a good time and place to talk. You should be honest with your guy friend about the fact you do not like him back. Have a sit down conversation with him at a good time and place[1]\n\nPick a time when your friend won't be stressed. You do not want to tell him right before a big football game or exam. Instead, wait for a weekend afternoon when neither you nor your friend have big plans or obligations.\nAs it's just going to be you and your friend, pick a place that does not look like a date. Going out to lunch together may feel date-like, so choose something more low-key. What do you and your friend normally do together? Maybe you like to hang out in the park. This may be a better location.\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nWrite some notes. It can be difficult to tell your friend you're not interested in him. In the moment, you may feel nervous. Therefore, try to write down your thoughts ahead of time. This will help you get a sense of how you feel, and figure out the best way to express that.[2]\n\nGet a pen or pencil and paper and jot down your thoughts. How do you feel? What is the best way to express this?\nFrom there, write down what you want from the conversation. Do you want you and your friend to work on salvaging the friendship? Do you need some space from this friend so he can sort out his feelings?\nYou should not read out what you're writing word-per-word during the discussion. This is more of a way to get your thoughts out. By writing out your thoughts ahead of time, you can better express them in the moment.\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nFeel some empathy for your friend. You want to try and get a sense of what your friend is feeling going into the conversation. Empathy is important at any point, but is vital to difficult conversations. Your friend may react negatively to the news, and you want to understand why so you do not become frustrated.[3]\n\nTry to think how you would feel in your friend's position. Imagine having feelings for someone, and thinking that person may feel the same way. It would be crushing to hear the truth. Your friend will likely feel sad and disappointed, and worried about the harm done to your friendship.\nCarry this empathy into the conversation. While talking to your friend, he may react poorly. He may become upset, or even angry. Try to remember your friend is going through something difficult. Remember what it's like to be in his shoes in the moment, and you'll be better equipped to cope with a negative reaction.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nRemain open-minded. If you go into the conversation with assumptions, this may change how you act. For example, if you expect your friend to get mad, you may go into the conversation with hostility. Conversely, if you think your friend will shake it off easily, you may come off as uncaring.[4]\n\nRemind yourself of what you don't know. You cannot know how a situation is going to unfold until it's occurring. Therefore, it makes no sense to make predictions.\nGo into the situation calm and optimistic, but with no assumptions on how your friend will react. By keeping your expectations open, you'll find it easier to deal with a range of potential reactions.\n\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Discussing Your Feelings","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nBe honest about how you feel. You want to make sure your friend understand you do not want a romantic relationship. You do not want to give a soft answer, that gives your friend hope that you'll change your mind in the future. You should be as honest as possible about how you're feeling.[5][6]\n\nExplain your feelings up front. You can begin the discussion with something like, \"I know you have feelings for me, but I don't have any romantic feelings for you.\"\nIt can help to explain the reasons for your feelings, as this can give your friend closure. However, remember that being honest does not mean being brutal.\nIf you want to give a reason, be tactful. Maybe you're just not attracted to your friend. Do not say, \"You're a little too short, and that's not my type physically, so I don't think it would work.\" You don't want to sound like you're tearing your friend apart. Instead, try something like, \"I just don't feel a physical spark between us.\"\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nMake it clear you want to maintain only a friendship. A lot of times, saying, \"Let's still be friends\" can be misinterpreted. People may take this as a sign you may change your mind.

Make it clear you want to continue the friendship, but without the hope of a romantic relationship.[7][8]\n\nEmphasize you value the friendship. Say something like, \"You are one of my best guy friends, though, and that's really important to me.\"\nHonesty is important when you make it clear you want to stay friends. Don't leave it at, \"Let's stay friends.\" Make it clear you only want friendship.

Remind him that you do still value the friendship.\nYour friend may also have some questions for you, regarding your feelings.

It can be very hard to return to a normal friendship after letting someone down. In the aftermath of your conversation, you and your friend may both need some space.[10]\n\nYou can try setting basic boundaries.

Show interest in his passions, troubles, successes, and failures. Ask him, for example, how debate team is going.

Your friend may continue to want a romantic relationship with you, and he cannot turn off how he feels.\nHowever, you cannot change how you feel either. This is equally important to remember.

Feelings of anger and resentment may build, especially if you start dating someone else.\nIt's important to avoid building resentment.

Let them know that things are okay between you two, and try your best to text, talk on the phone, and hang out just as much as you did before your friend asked you out.  And if you're the one being cut off?  Take this as a silent memo that your friend needs a little time to sort things out.
