You may feel a bit silly or intimidated at the thought of talking dirty on the phone, but once you adjust your mindset and let loose, you'll be on your way to making your phone partner helpless with pleasure. If you want to know how to do it, just follow these steps.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Get Ready to Talk Dirty","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nPick the right time to talk dirty. If you want to have a flawless dirty talk phone date, then you have to make sure that both you and your partner are alone and ready to start having a sexy conversation. Your dirty talk won't go very far if you're ready in bed while your partner is having dinner with his mom. Plan your dirty talk date in advance so both of you are free and alone at home or in your rooms.[1]\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nLook and feel sexy. Take a nice warm bath and put on some sexy lingerie and a hot outfit. Even if your partner won't be able to see what you're wearing, you'll be more easily turned on if you look ready for some action. You can even rub some scented oil or lotion on the nape of your neck to get you in the mood.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nSet the mood. Would you have sex with your dirty laundry all over your room and empty takeout containers all over your desk? Hopefully not. You shouldn't talk dirty until you're in a romantic atmosphere either. Just clean up your space, dim the lights and light some candles, and lie in your clean, welcoming bed. Do whatever you would do to prepare to get it on for real.[2]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nDon't overthink it. Before you pick up the phone or start getting turned on, don't stare at yourself in the mirror or analyze every last thing you'll say to your lover. Even if you're a dirty talk virgin, the process will feel more natural if you just sit back, relax, and get ready for what's to come.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nStart getting turned on. This doesn't mean you should touch yourself -- unless you want to -- but it does mean that you should start getting in a sexy mental space. Close your eyes and think of your most illicit sexual fantasy, or remember the last time it got really hot and heavy between you and your lover.\nIf it helps, you can lightly caress your body to get in the mood. But you should save most of that for your phone conversation.\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Start Talking Dirty","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nFind your \"dirty talk\" voice. It should still sound like you -- but like a sexier, slower-talking version of you.[3] Don't use the same voice you would use to ask your honey how his day went. Instead, talk a bit lower and more slowly -- you can even lower your voice to a near-whisper if you want to. Just make sure it still sounds like you to an extent.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nGive your lover a few compliments. You don't have to say anything X-rated right away. Just start with a few basic compliments. Tell your special someone how much you've missed him, and how amazing his body is. You can even remind him of the last time you had sex and how hot it was. Just start saying nice things to your lover to get into the mood.[4] Here are some things you can say:\n\n\"I've been thinking about your toned arms all day.\"\n\"I miss you and your body so much.\"\n\"I love hearing your voice.\"\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nTalk about what you're wearing. Tell your lover what you're wearing and describe it in great detail. Talk about how your body looks in your clothes, and mention any parts that are exposed. Ask your lover what he or she is wearing and close your eyes and imagine him or her in those clothes. Here are some ways to describe what you're wearing:\n\nFor women:\n\n\"I'm wearing your favorite bra.\"\n\"I'm not wearing any underwear.\"\n\"My dress is really tight around my chest.\"\n\n\nFor men:\n\n\"My shirt is tight around my biceps.\"\n\"I'm wearing that belt you love to take off.\"\n\"I'm wearing a button-down shirt. It comes off pretty easily.\"\n\n\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nTalk about what you would do if your lover was there. Start slow. Just say a few things that you wish would happen if your lover was there. You can get as graphic as you want, but you can start with the basics as you build toward your more elaborate fantasies. Here are some things you can say:\n\n\"I wish your arms were around me right now.\"\n\"I wish I could kiss your neck right now.\"\n\"If you were here, I'd start nibbling on your ear. You wouldn't be able to stop me.\"\n\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Get Hot and Heavy","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nTouch yourself -- and describe how it feels. You can do this at any point while you're talking dirty. But the earlier you do it, the more turned on you'll be. Start gently stroking your own body and let your lover know what you're doing. Then, ask him or her to touch his or her own body and be detailed about what you want him to do. Just like real foreplay, you don't have to touch yourselves anywhere too untoward -- just start with a light touch that turns you on.\n\nAs you keep talking, you can start touching yourself in your erogenous zones.\nLet your lover know exactly what you're doing to your body.

If you start to feel a sexy shiver after lightly caressing your neck, describe it.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nTell your lover how you'd want him to touch you.

Don't be shy -- tell your lover how turned on you are just from talking to him and thinking about him next to you. Let him know that you're excited and that you feel it all over your body. If you're so turned on that you feel it in your toes, tell your lover.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nReveal your greatest fantasies. Once you're really excited, share your fantasy with your lover, no matter how dirty it may be. He'll play along and talk about it with you, helping you get more turned on as you picture yourselves enacting the fantasy together. Don't be afraid to put it all out on the phone line -- just close your eyes and start talking.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nTake off your clothes -- and talk about it. Don't just start stripping -- let your lover in on the peep show, button by button. If you're taking off your shirt, let him know that it's sliding over your head. If you're taking off your belt, let your lady know that you're dropping your belt to the floor. Paint a picture of your body that will turn on your lover even more.\n\nYou can also ask your lover to take off his clothes. Ordering him or her around will be extra hot. You can just say, \"Now take off your shirt\" or, \"I want you to pull down your skirt.\"\nWhen you start taking off your clothes, you can ask your lover for validation. As you're taking off your shirt, you can ask, \"Are you sure you want me to take off my shirt?\" This will help paint a visual image for your lover.\n\n"},"part_step_6":{"stepNum":"7","stepText":"\nMasturbate. If you just want to talk dirty just for fun or practice, then you can get off the phone and get off on your own. But if you really want to commit to talking dirty, then you and your lover should touch yourselves until you orgasm. If you want to keep things hot and heavy, you can announce your orgasm, and tell your lover that you're about to come. This will build anticipation and will turn both of you on even more. Once you've both orgasmed, you can say goodbye and look forward to your next dirty talk date.\n\nDon't be shy -- tell your partner when you're touching yourself, and let him or her know how it's making you feel. Be as graphic as you want.\nAs in real sex, it's pretty difficult to climax at the same time as your partner. If you climax first, just keep talking dirty to turn on your partner. Don't stop and ruin the mood. Keep talking dirty until both people are satisfied.\n\n"},"part_step_7":{"stepNum":"8","stepText":"\nHave a sexy goodbye. Don't start transitioning into talking about how your days went; don't start telling goofy jokes, either. Just as you would cuddle after real sex, say some sweet, soft words to your lover and let him know how amazing he makes you feel. Get off the phone after a little while -- if you want to have a normal conversation with your lover, do it a bit later, so you can enjoy the sexy feeling after your dirty talk date.\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-Dirty-to-a-Guy","title":"How to Talk Dirty to a Guy","content":{"intro":"Updated: June 17, 2019\n\tExplore this Article\n\t\tBuilding up to It\n\t\tSending Racy Texts and Emails\n\t\tTalking Dirty in Bed\n\t\tArticle Summary\n\t\tQuestions & Answers\n\t\tRelated Articles\nMany people feel ridiculous talking dirty, but with some experimenting to figure out what specifically works for you and your partner, it can be a lot of fun. Exactly what you say will depend on your age, experience, personal tastes, and the nature of your relationship.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Building up to It","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nConsider your guy’s personality. How comfortable is he with physical affection and romantic touching? How does he behave when you fool around? Is he fairly conservative, or does he love trying new things? What sort of language does he use in everyday life — is he okay with cussing?\n\nWhat you say while talking dirty will depend largely upon your partner’s personality — if he’s very conservative and/or doesn’t like swearing, you’ll want to be subtle.\nFor example, instead of saying “You look so hot right now, I can’t wait to get you alone,” you could say “Looking good!” and then give him a quick flirty kiss on the lips or — if he’s not into public displays of affection (PDAs) — on the cheek.\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nTest the waters. Get a sense of how open to dirty talk he is but starting with things that aren’t overtly sexual. Dirty talk doesn’t have to be filthy. It can be as tame as texting him, “I can’t stop thinking about last night ;)” the day after you’ve fooled around.\nYou can even start with simply complimenting him more, for example, saying things like “That shirt looks great on you” or “I like that dimple there, that shows when you smile.”\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nTouch him more often. Many couples aren’t physically affectionate outside of the bedroom. By touching him more often, you might be able to increase his desire and make him feel more comfortable with you and, as a result, open to trying new things.[1]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nTalk about making out. If your partner is open to it, talk to him about what you’d like to try. Be respectful with what you say. Most importantly, never talk about making out right after you’ve done it, as this could make him associate your physical romance with having serious talks.[2]\n\nExample: “I love/really like/enjoy being with/etc. you, and I’d like to feel more connected to you. I was thinking maybe we could experiment a bit with talking dirty to each other.”[3][4]\n\nYou could even be more casual, and just say “What do you think about dirty talk?” You could say this while washing dishes together, making dinner, going for a walk — just NOT in the bedroom or after you’ve made out!\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nGet a self-help book. If you’re finding it very difficult to bring up dirty talk, you might consider getting a book on it and bookmarking some of the pages. You could even tell your guy that you feel embarrassed talking about it, so instead you’re showing him what you want to talk about with a book.[5]\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nPractise talking dirty by yourself. It may feel really silly, but practising the phrases you'd like to say to him might help you feel more comfortable with saying them when you’re actually with him.[6]\nIf you aren’t comfortable talking dirty when you’re by yourself, you can also just practise being more vocal in everyday life — for example, if you eat something delicious, let out a little sigh of delight, or when he kisses you, make a happy little “Mmm” sound.\n"},"part_step_6":{"stepNum":"7","stepText":"\nTailor your talk to the situation. What you say and how you say it will depend on the result you’re hoping to achieve.\n\nIf you’re away from each other — perhaps both at school or work — and you just want to tease him a little, you could send him a text like, “I can’t stop thinking about how good you looked this morning/last night/etc.”\nIf you’re making out and he does something that you like, you could say “I love it when you do that.”\n\n"},"part_step_7":{"stepNum":"8","stepText":"\nAlways be sincere. Whether paying a compliment, sending dirty texts, or talking dirty in bed, make sure that you mean what you say. Done right, talking dirty can improve intimacy and strengthen your relationship. Faking it will do the opposite. \n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Sending Racy Texts and Emails","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nEase into the conversation. Don't bust out an R-rated text in the middle of a conversation about his family, dead dog, or otherwise inappropriate topic. If you want to initiate dirty texts, do it tastefully. Start off with something like \"I wish you were,\" or \"I wish I could be with you right now.\"\nThe key is to give him a chance to reciprocate before getting into the racier stuff.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nDon't abbreviate. It may be the 21st century, but bad grammar will never be sexy (i.e. \"I want u 2…\"). If you have something good to say, spend the extra couple seconds it takes to spell it out completely.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nAmp it up. Once you’ve established that he's into dirty texts, you can get dirtier and more explicit. If you're unsure of what level to take it to, take small steps and parallel what he does.\n\nEnding flirty texts with a winking emoticon ( ;) ) is common practice.[7]\n\nIf he doesn’t respond in kind to your text, it might be that he really doesn't get the hint, but it also might be that he doesn't want to go there. You’ll need to gauge his response based on what you know about him. It might even be that he’s acting like he doesn’t get the hint just to be funny. Example:\n\nYou: “I’m excited for dinner but part of me just wants to skip straight to ‘dessert’ ;)”\nHim: “Yeah! The restaurant has the best fudge brownie sundaes!”\nYou: “Hehe well I’m excited for those too — but that wasn’t really the ‘dessert’ I meant :P” or if you’re really unsure, you could just respond with “:P” which is vague enough that it should give him the hint you meant something else, but not completely confirm it (lest it makes him uncomfortable).\n\n\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nSend flirty photos. What you send will depend on the relationship — it could be anything from a cute picture of you smiling to something that shows more skin.\nTry sending him a photo striptease: send a photo of yourself looking naughty with your clothes on, then photos of articles of your clothing (your shirt, your pants, etc.) as you take them off. Don’t send him a pic of yourself naked — let him imagine that![8]\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nBe careful when sending pictures. Never assume that your private photos will be kept private. If you are concerned at all about everyone seeing you in compromising positions, don’t take the photos. At the very least, consider leaving your face out of the photos.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Snapchat is NOT a safe way to send sexy pictures of yourself. Apps exist that make it possible to permanently save Snapchat photos.\nEven if you completely trust your partner and believe that you will never break up, understand that if something goes wrong in the relationship, you might not be able to get those pictures back, and you won’t have control over who sees them — it’s possible that he could share them with others. It’s not fair, and ultimately it’s not your fault, but it’s a reality that you need to acknowledge.\n\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nDon't \"sext\" from your work computer. Not only will you run the risk of getting caught in the act, it is also completely inappropriate. Keep in mind that some companies use keystroke loggers or other modes of surveillance to monitor productivity.\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Talking Dirty in Bed","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nEase into it. If things are just getting started, it might feel unnatural to break out the dirty talk right away. If you don’t already do it, try moaning and sighing more while making out to express how good he makes you feel.\nIf you’re uncomfortable with moaning or you’re not sure how it should sound, start paying attention to the sounds you make on a regular basis — for example, maybe you let out an “Mmmm” or a little happy sigh when you eat something delicious. That can work in romantic situations, too!\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nStart with one word at a time. If you are normally on the quiet side when you’re making out, you probably aren't ready for full-on sentences yet. Start off with just one or two words at a time to show him you're enjoying yourself.\nExamples: “yes,” “that’s nice,” “oh god” (if you’re religious, you could say “oh my gosh” instead).\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nPay attention to how you say things. How you say things is as important as what you say — for example, if you say “I love that” in a bored, monotone voice, it probably won’t sound sincere to your guy. Speaking in a breathy or lower pitch can help you sound a bit sexier. Whispering things in his ear is also nice!\n\nThere is no need to cuss when engaging in dirty talk, so if you're really not comfortable with swearing, just don’t do it! “You’re so #@$!-ing hot\" can be just as affective as “You’re so hot.”\nIf you decide to speak in a lower pitch, be sure not to go too low — you don’t want to sound like your possessed!\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nCombine touch with words. Instead of saying “do you like it when I XYZ?” (XYZ meaning “fill in the blanks”) or “do you want me to XYZ?” do something and then ask him if he likes it.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nLet him know when he's doing something right. Men have a lot of pride when it comes to romance. If he does something in bed that you enjoy, then say so. It will not only make him feel good, but will also encourage him to do it again in the future.\n\nExamples: “yeah, just like that”, “that feels amazing/so good”[9]\n\nIf you want him to do something but are too afraid to ask, say \"I love it when you XYZ.”\n\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nTell him how excited he makes you. Knowing that you're enjoying yourself will make him enjoy himself even more than he already is. Examples of what to say:\n\n“I’ve been craving this all day.”\n“I’m so crazy about you.”\n\n"},"part_step_6":{"stepNum":"7","stepText":"\nUse the magic words. Want to send him over the edge? In a poll conducted by Cosmo magazine, men voted that the #1 hottest thing to say in bed is \"I'm coming.\"[10] Men love hearing this because a) it boosts their pride; b) it turns them on to know you’re going to come; and c) it lets them know that they can stop holding back and come too.\nBe sure that you’re actually coming before you say these words. If you say it when you don’t mean it, you’re not only lying to him, but if he comes as a result of it, you might end up stopping (or at the very least pausing) your make-out session!\n"},"part_step_7":{"stepNum":"8","stepText":"\nDon’t go over the top. If moaning doesn’t feel natural to you, it might be tempting to act how you think you should feel instead of how you actually feel; this can lead to over-acting. You don’t need to scream or gasp or be otherwise over the top to show how excited you are — doing so might even make you sound fake.\n"},"part_step_8":{"stepNum":"9","stepText":"\nPay attention to what he likes. If he enjoys what you’re doing, he’ll likely moan or tremble lightly, or even stop for a moment to collect himself before continuing to make out with you.\n\nIf your partner is uncomfortable with what you say, he might also stop, but for different reasons, and it will likely be clear just from his body language — pulling away from you, not smiling, losing his hardness.\nIf you two are able to communicate easily, he will likely just let you know verbally that he didn’t like what you said.\n\n"},"part_step_9":{"stepNum":"10","stepText":"\nBe patient. Figuring out exactly what to say when talking dirty to your guy could take some time. As you try out more words and phrases, you’ll discover what works and what doesn’t.\n\nWhile moaning, sighing, and words like “oh god” and “yes” are generally well received, more extreme phrases (ex., phrases using swear words or explicitly describing sex acts) could make him uncomfortable.\nWith open communication and attention to his body language, the two of you will figure out what works!\n\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-Dirty","title":"How to Talk Dirty","content":{"intro":"Updated: July 8, 2019\n\tExplore this Article\n\t\tStarting To Talk Dirty\n\t\tGetting More Specific\n\t\tTalking Dirty Smartly\n\t\tArticle Summary\n\t\tQuestions & Answers\n\t\tRelated Articles\nTalking dirty is a great way to connect with your lover and to kick things up a notch in the bedroom.

This could be a win-win situation for both of you!\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Deciding If and How You Should Ask Her","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nMake sure you're being fair. If you're worried about your girlfriend talking to a guy because he gives you bad vibes, it's appropriate to tell her so. However, if you're simply being jealous, it's not always a good idea to request your girlfriend stay away from a guy. This can easily backfire.[7]\n\nIf you're feeling jealous, look at the situation from a rational perspective. Is your girlfriend really going to be receptive to you asking her to not talk to a guy simply because you're insecure? Probably not.\nThink about if your jealousy is even related to the guy, or if it’s part of a bigger issue. For example, maybe your jealousy is actually a reaction to your girlfriend being busier than usual.\nIf jealousy is the main culprit, it's better to have a conversation about why you're feeling jealous and how the two of you can cope as a couple.\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nPut yourself in your girlfriend's shoes. In any difficult conversation, empathy is key to successfully talking things out. Before you talk to your girlfriend, sit down and put yourself in her shoes. Try to imagine where she's coming from.[8]\n\nFor example, maybe she talks to an ex-boyfriend and the two often seem flirtatious with each other. While this behavior may feel hurtful to you, perhaps your girlfriend sees it differently.\nThink about how your girlfriend may see this situation. Is she generally affectionate with other friends, regardless of gender? If so, this may simply be how she acts with everyone. She may not see the relationship as a problem.\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nWrite down your thoughts. Take a piece of paper and a pen or pencil. Jot down your thoughts and feelings on the situation. Then, read over the words you wrote down and think about how you could verbally express them. As it's often hard to express yourself during a stressful conversation, having some idea of what to say can help.[9]\nYou should not write down what you want to say word for word. It's important to leave some room for flexibility. However, having a rough idea of how you'll phrase things can help.\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nRelease any expectations you have. If you go into a conversation with specific expectations, you may become frustrated or angry if things unfold differently.

Unjustified jealousy is your problem and not your girlfriend's. If your girlfriend is not cheating on you or violating your boundaries, you're the one who needs to work on your jealousy.

Jealousy often stems from low self esteem. When you're feeling jealous, remember the good things about yourself.

Does she say she loves your sense of humor or your kind personality? Keep this in mind, as it can curb feelings of jealousy.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nAssess your jealousy. Jealous people are often chronically insecure. They also may have issues from their past contributing to jealousy. Did you struggle to make attachments to caregivers early in life?

Making demands of your girlfriend is not the best means to deal with your jealousy. When you feel jealous, find healthier ways to regulate your emotions.[14]\n\nWhen your thoughts start to get out of control, ground yourself in the present with mindfulness. Tune into your senses and notice the pattern of your breathing.\nTry other stress reduction techniques as well. Journal, exercise, or  watch a movie to get your mind off your thoughts.\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nDevelop interests outside your relationship. If your relationship is the only thing you have going for you, you're more likely to obsess over it. Build up relationships with friends and family members. Take up a hobby or join a club.

Or are you stumped on how to talk to the guy you're dating on the phone? Whether it's your crush or your boyfriend, it can be difficult to know what to say to a guy on the phone. Here are some ways for you to call that special guy in your life.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Calling Your Crush","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nThink of what to say. Before calling, think about some topics that you know interest him. Discussing a movie he likes, a sport he plays, or a video game you now he plays are good ways to get him talking and to learn more about him. Maybe you are in class together and you need some help on an assignment. You can write down a list of topics to go through, but don't rely on that too much. You want to make it casual and impromptu.\n\nAsk him things like \"How did baseball practice go last night?\" or \"What are you writing your term paper about?\" to get him talking about things he loves or knows. These are open enough that he can elaborate and will get him talking.\nMake sure to focus on a few topics that you know a little bit more about as well. You don't want it to seem fake or rehearsed when you talk about these topics.[1]\n\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nRelax. Once you've planned a few things to say, take a few deep breaths. If you are too jittery or uncomfortable, it is likely that he will feel uncomfortable as well or you could scare him off. Just act natural, be yourself, and remember, he is just a guy.\n\nMake sure you are in a place where you're comfortable and are not likely to get interrupted. You are more likely to be relaxed and confident in your conversation.\nIt might not just be you that's nervous. If you have been giving hints that you like him, he might be waiting for a more obvious sign that you do in fact like him. Calling him is a good way to get this across.[2]\n\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nFind the right greeting. Whether he picks up, someone else picks up, or he isn't there, think about what you are going to say. When he answers the phone, give a casual but excited greeting. Since you've never talked to him on the phone before, make sure you mention who it is, saying something such as \"Hi, this is Mary. How have you been?\". People generally sound different on the phone than they do in real life.[3]\n\nIf someone other than the guy answers the phone, don't be nervous to ask for him. Just be polite and ask if he is available.\nIf you get his voicemail, stay calm. Leave a message, letting him know who you are, your number, and that you want him to call you back. If you think your date is silly or fun enough, you can leave a goofy message for him, something along the lines of \"If you can't reach me when you call, I might be out, or I might have gotten abducted by aliens.\" It shows that you know what kind of guy he is and that you're not too serious.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nAsk engaging questions. Ask questions that have more than one word answers, such as \"What do you think of the movie you saw last weekend?\" or \"What is the best part of that new game I heard you bought?\". This is the time to use the list of topics you thought about before you called him. Find a way to bring up those topics and then ask him questions about them. This gets him talking about his interests and lets him know you noticed him.[4]\nTry to avoid questions like \"What's up?\". They are very vague and don't give the conversation anywhere to go. Also avoid asking what his favorite food or color is. These questions are really common and won't make you seem interested or interesting. This is the time to show him how great you are.[5]\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nListen. You don't want to monopolize the conversation, so make sure you listen to him as much as you talk. No one likes it when they spend the entire time on the phone and can't get a word in. Also pay attention when he's answering the questions you ask him. Respond to things he says, giving your input when needed or laughing when he makes a joke or says something funny.\nEven if you have something you really want to say, make sure you don't interrupt him. You don't want to seem rude and want to give him plenty of time to get his thoughts out. He would probably love to hear what you have to say, just wait until the right time to give your response.[6][7]\n\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nAnswer thoughtfully. Pay attention to the questions he asks you. Give adequate, lengthy responses that fully answer his questions. If you give clipped, short answers, he might think you aren't interested.

Also try to incorporate some of your interests into your responses, with topic starters like \"I've never played that video game, but I'm really love playing strategy board games.\" These give him little hints about you and will help you two get to know one another. [8]\n\nDon't overshare. You want to keep some things to talk about at a later time, hopefully when he asks you out on a date. You also want to keep him interested.[9]\n\nTry not to sound cocky.

Find a natural place to end the conversation without sounding rude. You can either use a real or fake excuse, but cut off the conversation when it is still going well. This will leave him wanting more and will encourage him to call you next time. Try to say things like \"I had a great time talking to you, but I'm meeting my friends for coffee in half an hour.\" This let's him know that you like him but also lets him know you aren't going to be sitting at home waiting by the phone.[10]\n\nYou don't want to keep him on the phone too long. If either of you are pausing too long or are trying to fill the silence, it means you've probably gone on too long. Try to figure out a way to pick up the conversation before you hang up. You don't want to leave it on a low note.[11]\n\nMost guys don't talk on the phone that much, so an extended conversation might not be his thing.

Try to remember small details that he's brought up when you were last together, such as \"How did that paper turn out that you were working on a few days ago?\" This way, he knows you pay attention to him when you're together and knows you care.\nThis is especially helpful if you find that you've run out of things to say the last few times you've been together or talked on the phone.

They tend to stall conversations, while open-ended questions can help it keep going.[7]\nFor example, instead of asking “Did you like the movie?,” you might say, “What were your favorite things about the movie?”\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nListen to her. You may be tempted to impress her by doing most of the talking over the phone, but that can be a mistake. Give her a chance to speak and listen carefully to what she has to say. That will let her know that her thoughts and opinions genuinely matter to you.[8]\n\nIf she’s telling a story, make sure to let her know that you’re paying attention. When she pauses, you might say “Really?” so she knows you’re following along.\nDon’t be afraid to ask her questions when she’s talking either. That’s another way to let her know that you’re paying attention.\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nGet to the point. While it’s good to make small talk with her about her interests and what’s going on in her life, you don’t want to let the conversation ramble on aimlessly. After the initial pleasantries, explain why you called. In most cases, she’ll appreciate your being direct.[9]\n\nFor example, you might say, “I was calling to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow night.\"\nYou can also say something like,“I was calling to see if I could get that pasta sauce recipe we talked about.”\n\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Flirting with Her Over the Phone","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nDeepen your voice. If you’re trying to flirt with her, you want to sound confident and sure of yourself. Lowering your voice a little so it doesn’t sound squeaky or timid can definitely help. Make sure that you speak loudly, though, so she can hear everything you say.[10]\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nSpeak clearly and slowly. When you're nervous, you may have a habit of talking quickly. If you want to sound flirty, though, try to slow down your speech and speak clearly. That will help you sound more confident, which is important when you're flirting.[11]\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nOffer compliments. When you’re trying to win a girl over, making her feel good about herself can certainly do the trick. Compliment the things that you like about her, but be honest and try not to sound too cheesy.[12]\n\nFor example, you might say, “I meant to tell you the other day… you looked really pretty in that blue dress.”\nDon’t just focus on her physical attributes when you’re complimenting her. If you’re impressed by her sense of humor, intelligence, kindness, or other qualities, make sure to tell her about those too.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nKeep the topics light. When you’re trying to be flirty, it’s best to avoid heavy topics, such as your sick friend or the layoffs happening at work. Instead, stick to fun, happy subjects, such as your new cat or the trip you recently took to an amusement park.[13]\n"}},"part_3":{"partHeading":"Ending the Call","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nTell her you enjoyed talking to her. When you’re getting ready to wind down the call, you want to make sure that she knows you appreciated the time she spent talking to you. Let her know that you enjoyed your conversation and you’d like to talk to her again in the future.\n\nFor example, you might say, “Talking to you was really fun. Let’s do it again.\"\nYou can also say something like, “This was a really great conversation. Maybe we can continue it tomorrow at lunch?”\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nFinalize any plans. If you called her for a specific reason, be sure to go over the details before ending the conversation. For example, if you asked her on a date and she agreed, make sure you know when you’re going and where you’re going to meet.[14]\nEven if you haven’t made a date or plans, it’s a good idea to mention when you’ll see her again before you end the call. For example, you might say, “I’ll probably see you this weekend at Jake’s birthday party. Let’s talk more then.”\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nOffer a sincere goodbye. When you’re finished with the conversation, you’ll want to say goodbye. Depending on the time of day, you might end the call by saying, “Have a good night” or “Have a good day.” You can also be more casual and say, “See you later” or “Take care.” Just be sincere so she knows that you mean what you’re saying.[15]\n"}},"part_4":{"partHeading":"Conversation Help"}}}]
