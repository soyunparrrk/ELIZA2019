So go hug her!\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Hugging Her Goodbye","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nGet to know her. Walk with her. Talk with her. The more time you spend with her, the more natural it will be to hug her.\n\nConsider holding her hand. Don't ask her: just reach for her hand while you're walking together and twine your fingers into hers. This establishes physical intimacy, but it isn't as heavy as a hug.\nIf she is very shy or reserved, she may not be comfortable hugging in public, at least not at first.

No matter the situation, you're probably going to tell her goodbye, and you can easily turn this into a hug.\nIf you are walking together, slow down until you are at a complete stop. If she keeps walking, she may not be ready for the hug.\nSay, \"Well, I'd better get to class.\" or \"It's been great talking to you.\" This will establish that you're leaving without saying \"goodbye\" yet. Consider saying something romantic, like \"I really like you.\" or \"You have such a beautiful smile.\" If it's a new relationship, try not to come on too strong and say something like \"I love you.\" This might scare her.\nLook into her eyes.

She'll just hug you back.\nIt doesn't matter too much whether your arms are on top, or her arms are on top. If you're much taller than her, it may feel more natural to hug her around the shoulders while she hugs you around the waist. When you're more intimate with her, you may want to hug her with your arms below hers--this brings your faces closer together.\nDon't hug too tight. Be careful not to hurt her or make her uncomfortable. You should be holding her gently, but not squeezing her. If she squeezes you, by all means squeeze her back.\nBear in mind that if she shrinks back from the hug at first, she may just be surprised.

Open your arms, hold her firmly, and let her cry into your shoulder.\nHug her when she's happy. If she's excited, open your arms and step toward her to offer a hug. Odds are, she'll take the hint and jump into your arms.\nHug her when you feel emotionally close to her. If you've just said romantic words to each other--something like \"I like you a lot.\" or \"I'm so glad you're my girlfriend.\"--try to hug her in the heat of the moment.

Consider putting your arm around her during a movie, a concert, a school play, in the backseat of a car, or on a ferris wheel.\nMake sure that the seat you're sitting in has a back-side to rest your arm on. Couches are great for this.\nConsider picking a time when there aren't many other people around. She may feel self-conscious if a lot of her friends, or yours, see you make your move.

She should be comfortable, and you should be comfortable.\nWait for the right moment: maybe there's a romantic scene taking place in the movie, or maybe it's a slow, cinematic scene when there's no dialogue and the music swells. Avoid making your move during an especially tense moment, such as a chase scene or a scene with complex dialogue. When you put your arm around her, the movie is the last thing that she'll be thinking about, and she might be irritated if you make her miss something important.\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nMake the move. Lift your arm slowly but purposely and reach behind her. Lay your arm against the back of the couch or seat, and gently rest your arm along the ridge of her shoulders.\n\nPlay it cool. Be casual and nonchalant. If she doesn't shake your arm away, there's a good chance that she's into it. Leave your arm where it is and keep watching the show.\nKeep acting the same way that you were doing before, but feel about ten times cooler.\nIf she shrugs your arm away or moves your arm off of her shoulder, don't push it. She isn't in the mood, or she isn't interested. Keep your cool and keep watching the show.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nConsider yawning for effect.

Pressing your upper half into his can indicate romantic interest, but it is still fairly tame. Allowing your hands to roam or your legs to intertwine, however, is a great way to kick it up a notch and suggest stronger desire.\n\nMassage his back, neck or chest lightly with your fingers to kick things up a notch.\nPull his face down into a kiss if it feels right, or if you're both looking for more than a hug.\n\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nGradually ease out of the embrace when it feels right.

You don't have to be dating someone to give them a good, warm hug. However, with guys you aren't romantically involved with, you generally need to give him a little heads up. Make eye contact, smile, and open your arms up. Unless he firmly sticks his hand out for a shake or seems to shy away/avoid eye contact, just move into the hug.\nBe flexible -- if he doesn't seem to want a hug, don't hug him.

You'll end up close enough that you can comfortably get your arms around each other and touch chests. In general, your feet will be 6-8\" away from each other, but don't worry about it too much. It is a casual hug, so just be casual about it. Unless you're pressing your entire body into his and pulling him in close, you're not going to send the wrong signal.\n\nOpen your arms as wide as you feel. You can feel free to open your arms wide if you want a big hug.\nIf he doesn't seem like he wants a hug, you could give him a side hug.

Instead, concentrate on the guy you are hugging and try to enjoy the moment.\nJust laugh if anything goes wrong or feels awkward. Hugs are not complex signals or mating rituals -- they're a pleasant way to greet someone. Don't overthink it!\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nEmbrace him warmly and briefly. To embrace warmly, try to think about him and not yourself, enjoy the moment, and give him a firm but gentle squeeze.

This will give you a good 2-3 second hug.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nStep away, re-establish eye contact and smile again. Ease gently out of the hug and step back -- he'll do the same thing 99% of the time.

In the rare case that a guy seems extra persistent, you can try to guide his hand to yours with your free hand, making it extra clear that you want no more than a handshake.\nIf you really, really, don't want to hug them, give your best smile and say something like \"It's great to see you, let me shake your hand.\"[5]\n\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Romantically-Hug-a-Woman","title":"How to Romantically Hug a Woman","content":{"intro":"Updated: August 15, 2019\n\tExplore this Article\n\t\tSetting the Mood\n\t\tInitiating the Hug\n\t\tMaking it More Romantic\n\t\tAsk a Question\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\tReferences\nGive a woman a hug she'll remember.

If you are like most people, you are probably stressed about making sure you do it right so that she knows you care about her, instead of feeling awkward or grossed out.

It is always nice to be greeted by friends with a quick \"friends\" hug (even if you want to be more than friends).\nDuring an emotional moment.  Whether you are on the same team that just won a big game, or if she is having a hard day, a hug can be a really good way to reinforce that you are there for her.\nWhen you are parting ways.

Girls make it obvious with their body language when they are open to physical contact.

The average \"hello\" or \"goodbye\" hug should be about one or two seconds of holding.\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nRelease.

Generally, \"Congratulations!\" is a great thing to say.\nFor a comforting hug, tailor what you say to the situation. \"It's OK,\" or \"I'm here,\" are both good things to say.\nFor the buddy hug, say whatever sparked the hug in the first place. \"You're awesome,\" or  \"We really rocked that ultimate Frisbee game, didn't we?\" is always fun.\nIf it was a more intimate hug, we will leave those follow-up words to you.

You can put your arms around her waist or higher up her back. The lower your hands go on her back, the more suggestive the hug is. This can be a very intimate hug—use it wisely.\nBig bear and little bear: Her arms will go below yours and you will wrap around her back while her arms wrap around your waist.  This is a friendlier hug and allows her to be pulled close to you and have her head rest on your chest.\nOne-arm sling: This is the least romantic kind of hug—more of a buddy hug, really. This is when the hugger comes in from the side and wraps one arm around her shoulders or neck, as a casual friendly hug.\nT-Rex: Both the hugger and the girl's arms stay around the waist and lower back area. This will allow for the both of you to rest your heads on each others shoulders. This is going to allow for a friendlier, less suggestive hug.\nCriss-cross: One arm goes up and the other goes down to create an \"x\" with your arms and hers. This can lead to the perfect \"pull back and kiss\" position where both of you still have your arms holding on to each other with enough room to still kiss.\nFrom behind: This is a hug you only do with a girl you know well, and unless she likes scary surprises, let her know it is you as you move into the hug.
