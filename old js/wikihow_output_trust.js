Trusting in someone can mean everything from telling a person your deepest secrets to knowing they'll be on time for an appointment. There are many levels of trust, but all require you to put your faith in someone.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Building Trust","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nOffer your trust first. Putting yourself out there is tough, but it is much easier to build trusting relationships if you are willing to take the first step. Try something small, like sharing a personal story, confiding a small anxiety, or asking someone to go on a date. If the person is rude or distant, then you can move on to someone else. But if they offer something back or sympathize with you, telling a similar story or agreeing to go on a date, then you’ve both taken the first step towards a trusting relationship.[1]\n\nRemeber to always be honest when you're trying to build trust. Even little lies can lead to large amounts of distrust later on.\nShare, but don't overshare. This can be intimidating at the beginning of any relationship.\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nBuild trust over time. Trust is not a switch that you can switch on or off. Rather, it's built up over time, growing alongside your relationship. Begin trusting people with little things – getting to a meeting on time, helping with small errands – before trusting someone with big secrets.\nThere is no need to force a judgment on someone right when you meet them.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nConfide in people slowly. Baring your secrets, fears, and insecurities requires a lot of trust. Sharing your emotions with someone often takes place later in a relationship, after you have already built up trust. Start confiding in someone slowly, seeing how they respond, before fully committing to trust them. Whenever you share stories with someone, ask yourself a few questions:\n\nDo they seem interested in what I have to say? Trust requires that both parties care about each other.\nAre they willing to share stories about themselves? Trust is a give and take, where both parties feel comfortable sharing.\nAre they dismissive, condescending, or oblivious to my worries and concerns? Trust requires respect.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nHave different levels of trust for different people. There is no set “level” of trust that you need with people. There are going to be some people who you trust a little, like coworkers or new acquaintances, and some people you would trust with your life. Instead of putting people into two categories, “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy,” look at trust as a spectrum.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nObserve a person’s actions and behaviors, not their words. It is easy to make a promise but hard to keep one. You should watch people’s actions to see if they are trustworthy, not follow their words. If you ask them for a favor, reserve your judgment until the job ends. By observing actions and not words you can view someone’s trust objectively, building trust based on facts.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nBe a trustworthy person in return. If you want to build trust with someone, you need to be trustworthy yourself. If you are constantly breaking promises, telling secrets, or showing up late, you will find that people do the same thing to you. Think about other people's needs. Offer your help and guidance, and listen to them when they talk to build a trusting relationship.\n\nNever share someone’s secrets with other people unless they are in need of help. For example, a depressed friend may confide in you that they have suicidal thoughts, but you should share this with a counselor or professional even if they ask you not to tell.\nKeep your promises, and don’t cancel plans once you’ve made them. That also means not making a promise unless you truly believe you will be able to keep it.\nIf someone asks you for a promise that you know you can't keep, let them know that you take promises very seriously and you can't guarantee the outcome they are requesting but that you will still try your best to follow through on the action.\nBe honest, even in difficult situations.\n\n"},"part_step_6":{"stepNum":"7","stepText":"\nRemember that no one is perfect. Unfortunately, people are always going to make mistakes – skipping a meeting, letting a secret slip, or acting selfishly. If you expect every person to “earn your trust” they will all fall short from time to time. Trusting someone is about seeing through a person’s occasional faults at the bigger picture.[2]\nWhen people make the same mistake time after time, or refuse to apologize for problems, they become untrustworthy.\n"},"part_step_7":{"stepNum":"8","stepText":"\nTrust yourself. If you believe someone is trustworthy, then go with your instincts. Likewise, if you have a gut feeling that they're untrustworthy, listen to that. Having faith in yourself not only makes it easier to build trust, it makes it easier to move on when someone breaks your trust. Know that you are emotionally stable and happy. This helps you feel comfortable taking a risk trusting other people.[3]\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Finding Trustworthy People","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nKnow that trustworthy people are reliable and on-time. Someone you trust values your time and opinion, and won’t put their interests first all the time. Being late to meetings, dates, or events with you is a sign that they may not be fully trustworthy.\nApply this concept within reason – everyone is late from time to time. The bigger issue is with people who are never on time or  constantly cancel or change plans with you.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nKnow that trustworthy people follow through on their words. There is often a big difference between what some people say and what they do, but trustworthy people practice what they preach. To trust someone you have to know that they will do the things they say they will. Trustworthy people, for example:\n\nKeep promises they have made.\nFinish jobs, chores, or errands they commit to doing.\nFollow through on plans made together.[4]\n\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nKnow that trustworthy people don’t lie. Liars are some of the most difficult people in the world to trust because you can never know what they are actually thinking about. If you catch someone making lies, even small ones, it is a major red-flag that they are not trustworthy. Make a mental note of any large exaggerations and white lies. If they happen every time you see someone, they are more likely than not untrustworthy.\n\nLiars often fidget, have trouble looking you in the eye, and change the details of stories frequently.[5]\n\nThis includes “lies by omission,” when people hide information from you to avoid tension or anger.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nKnow that trustworthy people will trust you back. More often than not, a trustworthy friend is willing to confide in you as well. They know that having trust is a two-way street, and you must feel comfortable sharing things if you want people to share back. When someone trusts you it is a signal that they value your friendship and opinion, making them less likely to do things that would damage your relationship.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nNote how someone talks about other people. If someone constantly tells you secrets or says things like, “Benny asked me not to say this, but...” then they will likely do the same with your secrets. The way people act around your is indicative of how they act when you are not around. If you think that other people shouldn’t trust this person, you probably shouldn’t trust them either.\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Repairing Trust after Trauma","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nKnow that it is normal to have trust issues after trauma. After difficult events, most people will become defensive and have a hard time trusting people. This is a survival instinct – trusting someone leaves you vulnerable for future pain. Thus, avoiding trust can protect you from harm.[6] Don’t blame yourself for having trust issues. Rather, acknowledge the pain and try to learn from the past.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nRemember that one person’s actions are not reflective of everyone. There are negative, mean, and untrustworthy people in the world. Most people, however, are kind and trusting, so don’t let one bad experience or person destroy your ability to trust again. Always remind yourself that there are good people around, too.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nSlow down your judgment. Oftentimes, when we're hurt, angry, or upset, we react emotionally and make the situation worse. Before deciding that you no longer trust someone, take a few minutes to ask yourself rational questions:\n\nWhat facts do I know about the incident?\nWhat am I guessing or assuming about this person?\nHow did I behave in this situation? Was I trustworthy?\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nKnow that people remember betrayal more than positive interactions. According to a Cornell University study,[7] our brains are hardwired to remember betrayal faster than good memories, even if the betrayal is small. Remember your positive interactions with someone as you rebuild trust. There are likely more good memories then you immediately remember.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nLook for sincere, meaningful apologies. People make mistakes, even people you thought you could trust. What matters most after an argument or incident is how the person responds. Quick or curt apologies often show that the person is not really apologizing. Usually, they simply want you to stop being angry at them. Truly sincere apologies are ones that you do not demand, when someone looks you in the eyes and asks for forgiveness. A sincere apology is the first step to rebuilding trust.\nOffer your own apologies for wrongdoing when applicable.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nAdjust your expectations. Just because someone has lost your trust doesn’t mean they are entirely untrustworthy. Instead of returning back to where you started, try trusting someone with smaller, more manageable things. When a friend tells secrets behind your back, you may not confide in them again. That doesn’t mean, however, that you cannot still hang out, work on projects, or talk with each other.[8]\n"},"part_step_6":{"stepNum":"7","stepText":"\nKnow that you may never fully trust someone who has hurt you. Unfortunately, though you can rebuild a lot of trust with someone, there are times when the wounds are too deep to be forgiven. If someone has proven to you that they are not trustworthy don't  feel bad for cutting them out of your life. You cannot open yourself up to be hurt or abused again.\n"},"part_step_7":{"stepNum":"8","stepText":"\nMake a counseling appointment if you still have severe trust issues. Major trauma has a lasting impact on the brain, and you should consider seeing a professional if you cannot build trust with people. A symptom of PTSD is an inability to trust. If you do not want to see a therapist, try out a support group in your area first.\nRemember that you are not alone with your issues – there are other people like you who are also struggling with trauma.[9]\n\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ATrust","title":"Category: Trust\n","content":{"intro":""}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ARestoring-Trust","title":"Category: Restoring Trust\n","content":{"intro":""}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Regain-Trust-in-Someone","title":"How to Regain Trust in Someone","content":{"intro":"Updated: May 3, 2019\n\tExplore this Article\n\t\tHelping Out Yourself First\n\t\tTaking Stock of What's Left\n\t\tSlowly Rebuilding Trust\n\t\tQuestions & Answers\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\tReferences\nRebuilding trust after a betrayal is one of the greatest challenges a relationship can face. When we trust someone, we’re not afraid to be goofy and quirky, and we freely share our hopes and our fears. Ultimately, it's trust that allows us to give and receive love. When trust is violated, we become self-conscious and hesitant for fear of another humiliation. But if the relationship is truly valuable and your love runs deep, trust can be re-established and relationships that survive disharmony often emerge stronger and more rewarding for the experience.\n","part_0":{"partHeading":"Helping Out Yourself First","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nTake some time away from the other person, if you haven't already. In order to regain trust in someone else, you need to heal. Quite possibly, this other person hurt you dearly. You'll want to grow from this situation by turning lemons into lemonade, but to do so, you should take a little time for yourself.[1]\n\nIn the heat of the moment, your emotions can cloud your judgment. That means that it's hard to think straight, and you could end up saying things that aren't exactly helpful in fixing the situation. How you feel is very important, and it's a big part of regaining trust, but it's also not productive if you don't step away for a little bit.\nIt's going to be hard not to think about what happened, but try to.[2]  At least for a little while. Do something so engaging that you become completely enthralled in the now — go away to a cabin by the lake with your friends, go rock climbing and sweat a little, or have a great conversation with a total stranger. For the time being, forget what happened.\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nDon't make yourself into a victim. You are a victim of the circumstances, but don't become the victim. Do you see the difference? The victim of circumstance understands that the betrayal of trust was one incident, while the victim feels like the entire relationship — all the good along with the bad — is now affected. The victim of circumstance wants to get over the incident; the victim wants to wallow in the pain that the other person caused them. Staying the victim sets up a big roadblock to regaining trust in someone.[3]\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nRemind yourself that not all is lost. Especially after a betrayal in a relationship, it's easy to feel like the world is being turned upside down and you're in a free fall, disconnected from everything you thought you knew. It's a very disheartening feeling. But it's not the truth.  There's still plenty of brightness in your life if you know where to look. Reminding yourself of this simple notion can do a lot to help rebuild trust.[4]\n\nTake a look at the simplest things in life that you still have. Your friends, family, and health are three profound things that you most likely still have, even if the person who betrayed you feels connected to each one of those things. Fall in love again with just how lucky you are to have these things.\nTry to look at the positive side of things. It may seem funny to think of a betrayal as having positive aspects, but it's certainly possible. Here's the big one: You've learned a lot about the other person as well as about yourself. If you choose to continue the relationship, you'll want to use these teachings to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nDon't do anything rash without thinking about it first. When someone we care about deeply betrays us and misplaces our trust, one of our gut reactions is to try to punish them for hurting us. If our boyfriend cheats on us, we go out and get cozy with that guy we once had a thing for; if our friend lies to us, we justify lying back to them. Try not to do anything crazy before thinking about it first. Here's how you might go about it in your head:\nAsk yourself: Are you doing this for yourself or in order to hurt the other person? If you're doing this for yourself, then go ahead — you earned it. But if you're doing something in order to hurt the person who hurt you, ditch the need to \"get back at\" the other person. When you try to put back together the pieces of your relationship, these actions will only stand in the way of making everything good again.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nBe social. After taking a little time for yourself to sort through things, get social again. There's nothing quite like social contact to remind you that the world goes on. And while no one is forcing you to move on with your life quite yet, it's a good idea to get some perspective on things. Perspective helps. Friends, colleagues, and even total strangers will help you get that.\nListen to your friends, but take anything they say with a grain of salt. They're probably somewhat disconnected from what happened, and they have a natural tendency to want to comfort you. (That's part of what they're there for.) Just don't take for granted that they know everything that's going on, or that they know what's best for your relationship.\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Taking Stock of What's Left","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nStart by evaluating the relationship. While it’s sad to see any relationship go — whether it's a friend or lover — sometimes the betrayal is a wake up call and a sign that there are many fish in the sea. Looking at the relationship as a whole should help you decide whether you want to regain trust in the person or whether you'll probably want to move on.\n\nWhat was the relationship like before the incident? Did you have fun and laugh frequently? Or did you feel like it was a constant chore and you were doing most, if not all, of the work.\nDid you feel listened to? Was your word as important as theirs? Were lines of communication free and open, or closed and constrained?\nDid you feel that you could rely on this person?\nWas the relationship balanced or was it one-sided and not in your favor?\nWas the betrayal out of character or, in retrospect, might you have seen this coming? Does the person have a history of breaking the trust of their friends or lovers?\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nExamine why you were in the relationship. This is another important exercise in self-discovery you should try to complete before you decide to allow yourself to trust the person who betrayed you. After all, if you're looking for the right things in the wrong places, you might do better to ditch this person and find someone else. It's hard to say, but it's tough medicine.\n\nAre you in a relationship because you need someone to complete you? This may be a problem. Asking someone to complete you is an impossible task. Only you can do that. If you're in a relationship because you need one in order to feel \"whole\", you should probably consider taking a break from dating.\nAre you asking for people to hurt you? Do you always date the same kind of person — the person who ends up hurting you in a fiery, dramatic spectacle? You might subconsciously be asking to be hurt because you don't think you deserve better. Well, you do. Improve your self esteem and don't settle for the kind of person you know will hurt you.\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nGrade your relationship. Sure, grading someone sounds callous, but it is an effective and honest way to assess whether or not this person meets your needs. Besides, we deserve five-star relationships, so make sure that's what you've got.\n\nIdentify three to five things you value most in a relationship. For some people laughter and emotional support will be among their top needs. For others, intellectual stimulation is a top priority.\nUsing your grading system, determine whether or not this person is meeting your needs and is compatible with your values. For example, if the person shares all your values and did an excellent job of meeting your needs except for the betrayal, it might be a good idea to give them a second chance. On the other hand, if the person doesn't really share any of your values but is an overall good person, the betrayal might mean it's time to move on.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nExamine the betrayal itself.  Indeed, some people are not deserving of your trust. But sometimes, a mistake hurts because it reminds us of previous a wound. A betrayal that is calculated or born of malicious intent is a clear indication that this person is no one you can trust. But mistakes that are accidental and out of character may deserve forgiveness.  Consider the following:\n\nWas it a calculated deceit, for example a cheating spouse, malicious gossip or sabotage by a co-worker?\nWas it accidental, like crashing your car or spilling the beans on a secret?\nWas it a one-time slip, or does the incident represent a long-standing pattern of behavior?\nConsider the circumstances: Is your friend or loved one going through a particularly trying time and could this have played a part in the injury?\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nMeasure the severity of the betrayal. Was it mild, moderate or severe? The severity of the betrayal is often going to be a good sign of the degree of pain the other person put you through.\n\n\nMild offenses include blurting a secret, telling 'white' lies (lies that are told to spare your feelings, as opposed to lies told to deceive you) and complimenting your romantic partner in a way that may have seemed flirtatious. These tend to be accidental and one-time incidents. Generally, if you express your concerns, they are met with an immediate and sincere apology and a promise to be more mindful of your feelings in the future.\n\nModerate offenses include gossiping about you, regularly borrowing money but rarely repaying you and regular disrespect. These behaviors reflect a lack of consideration and selfishness. It can be difficult to confront someone who seems indifferent to your feelings, but sometimes people are just oblivious. These flawed behaviors can be sometimes be talked through and resolved.\n\nSevere betrayals include stealing a significant amount of money, infidelity, spreading malicious gossip or lies, and sabotaging you at work or in some other endeavor. These are calculated betrayals, the perpetrator is aware of the grief he or she will cause and does it anyway. In such cases, you may need to seek professional guidance to salvage the relationship, if indeed you decide to forgive.\n\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Slowly Rebuilding Trust","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nFocus on all the positives of the relationship. If you’ve decided to forgive and move forward, one of the best ways to let go of resentment, anger and suspicion is to remind yourself of all of the wonderful things this person brings to your life. There's probably a reason — hopefully a lot of reasons — why you stayed in the relationship. Think about those as you begin to let the other person in.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nTry putting yourself in their shoes. It's hard to do, and it's not necessarily expected of you, but it will help save the relationship if that's what you want to do. Try to imagine what drove the person to betray you, indirectly or directly. Try to think about how the person feels at this very moment. You shouldn't make any decisions just because you pity someone, but showing empathy is an olive branch that will mean a lot to the other person.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nTalk about the incident. Be clear about your feelings, and give the other person a chance to speak. At the same time, know that asking for specific details can make the pain even worse.[5] This can make the healing process even harder.\n\nDiscuss the event. Explain how you interpreted the event and why you were hurt. Avoid accusatory language. Give the other person the opportunity to explain the situation from their perspective.\nEstablish your expectations and ask what is expected of you. This will help clarify the cause of the current problem, as well as avoid future disagreements.\nDon't expect to get through talking about the incident in one sitting. Make that clear to your friend or partner. The healing process is going to take some time, and that person should be prepared to talk about it for some time. If they're not prepared to, that's a sign that they may not care as much about mending the relationship as you do.\n\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nDepersonalize the incident. Often, hurtful behavior has much more to do with the other person than it does with us. Rather than face their own issues, people project them onto a close friend, family member or partner. If the incident was borne of the other person’s insecurity, help him or her deal with the pain. This will help you view the incident with compassion and help you to forgive. Here are a few examples of hurtful behaviors that are not personal attacks:\n\nSomeone makes a snide comment about your appearance because he or she feels unattractive.\nA partner flirts to feel desirable, not because you are unloving or unlovable.\nA friend is hyper-competitive because she feels inadequate.\nYou are sabotaged by a co-worker because he fears his work is inadequate.\n\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nTry to keep a positive outlook on things. If you fear the relationship or friendship just isn't going to work, but want to try anyway, you may as well throw in the towel right now. If you decide to give it another try, believe that it will work, not because you want it to, but because the other person has earned it.\nDon't constantly live in fear of the same betrayal happening again. Try to get back to normal as much as possible. If you find yourself living in the constant shadow of the betrayal, that's a sign that it's time to get out — both for your sake and for the other person's.\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nRecognize that we all make mistakes and think about the times you've received forgiveness.

No matter what your reasons may have been, take full ownership of your actions—admit the lie and don’t try to place the blame on anyone else.[1]\n\nFor example, you might say, “You’re right. I know I told you I wasn’t going to smoke anymore, but I gave in to temptation and had a couple cigarettes last night when I was out with my friends. I was afraid of what you’d think, so I lied about it when you asked me.”\nIdeally, you should own up to your lie before your partner finds out about it.

I was afraid you’d be mad, but I should have just been truthful.”\nYour apology should not minimize the seriousness of the lie or place any blame on your partner for the situation or their feelings (e.g., “I’m sorry you’re so upset. It was just a little white lie.”).\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nListen to what your partner has to say. After you’ve apologized, let your partner say their piece.

Being open may also help your partner to better understand where you are coming from.\n\nBeing vulnerable does not mean being weak. In fact, it requires a great deal of bravery to open up to another person and really be yourself, especially if you’re afraid of judgment or criticism.[8]\n\nIf you’ve lied in part because of your insecurities about your relationship with your partner, be open about that, too.

The timeframe will vary depending on the seriousness of your lie and the personalities and histories of you and your partner, but things should eventually get better if you stay consistent and honest.[9]\nDon’t push your partner to “get over it” or move on before they are ready.

Everybody wants to control personal information.[9] But, for a little while, you may need to forfeit a portion of your privacy for the sake of the person trying to trust you again.

Before you can rebuild trust in someone after they betrayed you, you should first ask yourself if the relationship is one you want to salvage.

If you want your relationship to be all it can be, both of you must learn how to create this kind of trust. Most couples only think of trust in terms of being sexually faithful, though essential, there’s more to it than just that. [1]","part_0":{"partHeading":"Committing to Mutual Core Relationship Values","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nStay faithful. If a partner is not loyal, a relationship quickly becomes unworkable. People do recover from an affair but usually need professional help to do it. Make a commitment to be faithful and stick to it. If you’re not happy in the relationship, get counseling and not a part-time lover.[2]\n\nIf you’re faithful to someone, it means you’re faithful on all levels. This means physically but also emotionally. Some people think it’s okay to establish intimate bonds even though they may just be spending time with another person and nothing else, but it’s really not. It will eventually cause problems in your relationship.\nBe clear with appropriate boundaries as much as possible. What is appropriate varies from culture to culture, and often with one's age. But it all comes down to understanding what is respectful, clear, and comfortable to ask from a romantic relationship.\nDating a person once is not a committed relationship, for instance. If asking a person out on a date, make sure that is clear; it can be awkward if a woman is not entirely sure she is at a restaurant as a friend or as a date.\nBe clear on if you see your sexual relationship as more casual or more serious. Some people are comfortable with \"booty calls\" and \"friends with benefits\" types of relationships. Others see sexual relations as a very deeply emotional act done only with someone committed to a relationship (or after marriage).\nThere are wide varieties of behaviors considered a \"committed relationship,\" from traditional marriage, to \"live-in boyfriend or girlfriend\", to more radical \"open marriages,\" and polyamory. A person seeking a traditional marriage may be disappointed if the partner is looking for something else. Likewise, someone seeking something else may be disappointed if the partner is looking for a traditional marriage.\n\n\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nGive your partner space, and foster kindness. Trust builds in an atmosphere of security and safety. The cycle of hurting each other, either verbally or physically, and then rejecting the other person, creates a lot of fear; which undermines trust. Furthermore, trying to control your partner’s every move is another type of mistrust, so make sure you’re not possessively clinging on to your partner. That will only push him or her away. [3]\nIf your significant other wants to spend time with their friends, try to be okay with that. You can always talk about what’s acceptable behavior and what’s not, though. For instance, if your partner says that he or she wants to go to a dance club with friends, and you’re not comfortable with it; then it’s something that you need to talk about, both in this instance, and for the future, so that it doesn’t keep happening again and again.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nLove your partner without any ulterior motives. Both of you need to feel sure you are loved for yourself, and not for some other reason. Those other reasons could be your family, your money, your looks, or even just the fear of being alone. Make sure you’re with your significant other for the right reasons.[4]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nMake your relationship a top priority. It can be easy to take each other for granted and neglect one another. Try not to give all of your energy and time to other people or activities. Keep your priorities clear. If being in a relationship is important to you, then make sure it stays at the top of your list.[5]\nAvoid becoming a workaholic because this can get in the way of your relationship. Make time for your relationship; and if you need to reach a goal at a specific time, work with your partner to develop solutions.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nStay to the end. Misunderstandings, conflict, and anger are going to occur. Make it safe for disagreements and the careful expression of anger to happen without raising a fear of abandonment. You do this by never using the threat of walking out.[6]\n"}},"part_1":{"partHeading":"Establishing Trust on Your End","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nKeep your routine. A lot of people believe that mixing things up all the time makes a great relationship. In other words, he or she is always planning something new to surprise the other. Although surprises are nice from time to time, stability and uniformity are far more important in a relationship. Uniformity sounds boring, but you need to be predictable to make things work in the long run. Predictability builds trust.[7]\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nBe reliable. Trust is just another way of saying you can rely on someone. You trust your partner to do certain things no matter what at all times. This trust builds security in a relationship. Make sure your partner can count on you.[8]\nIf you say you’re going to be home by 5 p.m., then make sure you are or at least let the other person know if something else comes up. The most important factor here is consistency. If 4 out of 5 times, you never bother calling and just come home as late as you want, then that’s a strong indicator that your needs matter more to you than your partner. A happy, successful relationship is when both parties make an effort at keeping up their end of the bargain.\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nMean what you say. Your partner can read your face better than anyone else. If you are lying or trying to hide some true feeling by not quite saying all that is on your mind, he or she will be able to tell. The person might even think you’re cheating. When the person knows he or she can trust whatever comes out of your mouth without hesitation, then you are building an unshakable bond.[9]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nTell the truth. Don't keep anything hidden, nothing should be privileged from the other. You have to know that sooner or later all things come to light, and the consequences of not being completely truthful will kill the trust and ruin your relationship.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nShare how you really feel. Too many people never let their partners know what they need. Don't let your partner wonder, or try to guess what he or she should do for you. It is essential this happens with both partners. If only one partner is being catered to by the other, there is a chance one will feel smothered or the other might feel neglected. Either scenario is not good.\nPractice vulnerability to allow for more closeness and intimacy in your relationship.[10]\n\n"},"part_step_5":{"stepNum":"6","stepText":"\nSay no sometimes. It’s okay to listen to your partner’s needs and try to fulfill them, but sometimes it's just as valuable to say no. You can't do everything all the time, and you will actually earn some respect when you refuse to do something once in a while. Taking a stand, and imposing your own will can actually enhance the trust between you.\n"}},"part_2":{"partHeading":"Fostering Trust in Your Significant Other","part_step_0":{"stepNum":"1","stepText":"\nHave faith in your partner's capabilities. In other words, if you believe at all that the person is not competent in some of the things he or she does, your trust will not be solid. If this is the case, you need to be upfront with him or her on the issues in an honest and loving manner. This will allow you to work through this and keep the trust with each other.\n"},"part_step_1":{"stepNum":"2","stepText":"\nTrust your partner. How can your partner trust you when you don't trust him or her? Having trust takes two people, and without the other person building trust, too, it's like a fish without water.\n\nThis is where you have the opportunity to practice vulnerability. Trusting another person often comes down to how you feel on the inside. In other words, if you tend to be insecure about things, then this could fall over into your relationship in a negative way. You have every reason to trust until the person actually does something that shows you cannot.\nBe open about any insecurities you may have. If you have any past experience with infidelity, let your partner know so they can understand what’s going through your head.[11]\n\n\n"},"part_step_2":{"stepNum":"3","stepText":"\nGive the benefit of the doubt. One indicator of trust issues is the tendency to think of the worst case in every possible situation. Just because someone missed your phone call doesn’t mean the person is cheating on you. When you trust your partner, it means you give him or her the benefit of the doubt. Each person deserves a chance to explain her or himself before coming to a conclusion. Only then can it be looked at objectively.[12]\n"},"part_step_3":{"stepNum":"4","stepText":"\nLeave your partner’s phone alone. Do either one of you have passwords on your phone? If so, it could be a sign that you have problems with trust. While privacy is important, it doesn’t mean your phone should be protected like it’s Fort Knox. When there’s real trust, the other person will respect your privacy even if he or she has access to your phone. But the bigger issue, however, is if you feel that the person calling your significant other’s phone is a threat to your relationship, then there are definite trust issues that need to be dealt with.\n"},"part_step_4":{"stepNum":"5","stepText":"\nAllow your partner free reign in life. Often, when there are trust issues, you want to monitor everything the other person does and with whom. It’s easy to feel territorial and feel threatened by everyone. However, trust is about having faith and allowing the other person free reign. When you trust someone else, it also means you trust yourself, which fosters healthier relationships in the long run.\n"}}}},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ABuilding-Trust","title":"Category: Building Trust\n","content":{"intro":""}}]
