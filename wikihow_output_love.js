Before loving anyone else, you have to love yourself. Learning to love yourself means accepting and appreciating the vulnerability within. You have many qualities that are unique to you. Learn to appreciate who you are and what you can offer. \n\nIf you have problems loving yourself, then work hard to build yourself up. Work on your self-confidence by accepting your past and moving forward. You may feel that things you did in the past will make you unlovable, or that you have too many problems to be lovable. Untrue. Accept the things that happened to you, forgive yourself, and move on.\nFor more information, check out How to Love Yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/47/Love-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nCare about yourself just as much as you care about others. This can be difficult if you find yourself as a natural caretaker or if you have children. Remember, your ability to take care of others increases if you are adequately taking care of yourself. \n\nDon’t let yourself become the last priority; instead, do things to show yourself you care. Treat yourself to a massage or a bath. Do one thing every day that is just for you.\nThis extends to maintaining boundaries and saying “no.” If what you need is some relaxation, say no to getting together with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 26\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Love-Step-26.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-26.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive gratitude. Grateful people have health benefits and report higher levels of happiness. Find ways to be grateful for things that surround you, and most importantly, for who you are.\nThink about the characteristics you have that you love about yourself. Maybe you are very compassionate, generous, or a good listener. Maybe you pick up new skills easily. Perhaps you create beautiful paintings or wire electricity like a pro. Take a moment and be grateful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/74/Love-Step-2.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nHave a good attitude. Even if situations seem negative, find something positive, big or small. Having a positive outlook is linked with health and emotional benefits, such as lower rates of distress and having a longer lifespan. When you start to have negative thoughts, especially about yourself, turn them into positive thoughts. \n\nUse positive self-talk to transform negative thoughts into positive thoughts.\nCombat thoughts about new situations. Instead of  “I’ll mess this up; I’m so foolish!” try “I feel proud of myself for trying something new and putting myself out there.”\nIf you think “I am so bad at meeting people” replace it with “I’m excited to learn new social skills and meet people more like me. I know I can succeed in making friends.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 28\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Love-Step-28.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-28.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nEngage in things that make you happy. Being happy is part of showing love to yourself. Create a state of happiness by doing things that make you feel good. Do things that make your body, mind, emotions, and spirit feel good. Happiness largely depends on putting in the effort to make your life more positive.\nYou can choose to meditate, practice yoga, paint or draw, kayak, hiking, practice Muay Thai or engage in lively discussions. Think about what brings a smile to your face, and go do it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 27\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Love-Step-27.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-27.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nTake some alone time. An important part of self-care is to spend some time alone. It can be difficult if you share a room or have children but save some time for yourself. Solitude can help you unwind, work through problems, reboot your mind, and discover yourself. Don’t feel guilty for wanting alone time. By spending time alone, you can improve your relationships by prioritizing your happiness and allowing yourself to reset.\n\nIt’s important to note that alone time doesn’t mean going on social media. Try to do things that enrich your life and make you feel good like taking a walk or journaling.\nIf you struggle to find alone time, wake up before other people, or spend your lunch breaks alone. Ask your partner to watch the kids for one hour each week so you can get out of the house and spend some time alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/61/Love-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nAccept that you don’t need a partner to feel complete. Some people believe that happiness and love can only be experienced through a relationship, or that a bad relationship is still better than no relationship at all. Staying in a relationship that does not work does not respect you or your partner. Solitude is different than being lonely, and it is not worth succumbing to social pressure to fit in or feel complete. \nIf you are unhappy or impatient being single, make the best of the situation. Pursue opportunities that are difficult to accomplish with a partner or a family. Travel, acquire lots of close friends and enjoy your perpetual freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nLoving a Partner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Love-Step-6.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nCommit. Put forth effort into the relationship and work hard to make it work. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are.\nCommit to the person and to the relationship. Put in work to make your partner feel special, and work toward making the relationship work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Love-Step-4.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nBe intimate. The word \"intimacy\" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Avoiding vulnerability can look like withdrawal, attack, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy can look like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Feelings or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust that has been developed.\n\nWhen you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Acknowledge whatever feelings come up and allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Take compassion on the feeling and be gentle with it.\nShare your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Love-Step-8.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAccept that love is dynamic. If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love can occur in waves. Sometimes you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times you experience less love to or from that person. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean that the feelings will last forever. Life happens in cycles, and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows.  Lots of things can create peaks and troughs in love, such as having children or growing older. You can work through them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Love-Step-17.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe open to receiving love. You don’t have to be the one in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control.  Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures toward you. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love does not have debts but multiplies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 21\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Love-Step-21.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nTouch your partner. Touching does not need to be sexual, but engaging in a long, supportive hug or reaching out for your partner’s hand is a way to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions.  Affection is a way to make your partner feel loved and for you to feel loving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Love-Step-16.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nExpress gratitude to your partner. Sometimes the way we communicate with a partner can be lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude. Thank your partner for showing that you notice the effort put into the relationship. Show appreciation for the things your partner does, and also for the qualities that your loved one embodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Love-Step-11.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nBe partners in life. The whole point of going through life with people you love is so that you can tackle life’s challenges together. Work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough. We can’t solve everything on our own, we can’t know everything there is to know... but a whole bunch of people getting together out of love can solve just about any problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nLoving Despite Differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/17/Love-Step-13.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nDon’t expect perfection. Don’t expect perfection in the person you love or in yourself. This sets incredibly unrealistic expectations. Neither of you will be able to live up to these standards, and you both will end up hurt and disappointed. Take it easy on yourself and your partner, and expect mistakes to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Love-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nLearn lessons and apply them to your relationships. Yes, bad things will happen in your relationships. You’ll say the wrong thing or your partner will hurt your feelings. It happens. The important part, when anything goes wrong (even if it’s just problems in your life), is to learn your lessons and keep moving forward. Try to make the most of any negative situation, turning it into something positive by gaining and growing from the experience. Honestly try to see your significant other's point of view in any argument that gets fairly serious.\nIf you're in the wrong, apologize and own up to your mistake. Good relationships air out the grievances and clear the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 24\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/Love-Step-24.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-24.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nReconcile your differences. It’s hard to feel love toward someone when you’re really mad or upset at your partner. Whether you and your partner become volatile or avoid fights, there’s actually no systematic differences in couple happiness. The important part is finding happiness together after the fight.\nBe aware that there's always the opportunity for reconciliation. Whether you have volatile screaming matches or you sit down together to compromise before things get too heated, almost every style of conflict allows for some form of reconciliation. No matter how you and your partner fight, make sure you both, in the end, feel heard and are able to come to some kind of agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Love Step 29\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Love-Step-29.jpg/aid34524-v4-728px-Love-Step-29.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBalance your negative and positive feelings toward each other. Balance is important in creating a happy and loving relationship. Research shows that with stability over time, the magic ratio for positive and negative interactions in relationships is five to one, or five positive interactions for every one negative interaction. When you recognize a negative action toward your partner, do your best to provide positive interactions to restore a sense of balance.\nPositive interactions include physical intimacy such as touching, smiling, and laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Category%3ALove","title":"Category: Love\n","content":[]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Person-Truly-Loves-You","title":"How to Know if a Person Truly Loves You","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nNotice How the Person Acts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/26/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-16-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nSee if the person can act naturally around you. Part of being in love means being completely open to the other person. If you find yourself seeing a whole different side that the person doesn't show the public, then that may be love. For instance, if your partner is pretty serious or polite in public, but shows a more goofy and silly side when you're alone, then they are really opening up to you and loves you.\n\nIf the person shares their deepest emotions with you and is comfortable with it, then that could be love.\n\nIf the person is comfortable not looking perfect, tripping, or having food stuck in their teeth around you, that means they are okay if you see every side of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nGauge if the person is happy to be around you. This should be true even during a bad day. If your loved one has had a very bad day but lights up when they see you, then that's a sign of love. If they are in love with you, then the sight of you or the sound of your voice is guaranteed to make them feel better — if only a little bit.\nThe next time they're grumpy or have a bad day, see how they react in your presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/49/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-18-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nNotice if the person gives you googly eyes. Though this may be silly, check out your loved one's face the next time you see them. Do they look at you in a goofy, watery, silly and adorable way that can only be described as \"googly-eyed\"? You will know it when you see it. You won't get this look all the time — you can spot it in the morning, or randomly across the dinner table.\nYou may also be able to catch the person staring at you with the same expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-19-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-19-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSee if the person is giddy around you. Love makes people feel giddy, weightless, and like laughing for no reason at all. If you see the person acting this way in your presence, then this may be love. Does your loved one seem hyper, excited, and on the verge of laughing for almost no reason at all whenever they are around you? If so, then this may be love.\n\nIf you've said something barely funny and the person cracks up, then they may be lovesick.\nIf the person shows nervous energy or fidgets around a lot around you, then they may just be excited by your presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 20\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-20-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-20-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAsk yourself if the person is upset when you are. If you are suffering unbelievable emotional pain or are just bummed because you have the flu, then this should rub off on the person who loves you. If they truly love you, then they'll absorb some of your negative emotions and will be very upset because they'll want you to feel better as soon as you can.\nThough they don't have to be as upset as you are, the person should clearly be affected by your mood because all they want is for you to be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nNotice What The Person Says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/69/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nNotice if the person talks positively about your future together. If the person really loves you, then the idea of you being in their future is an absolute given, not something that they would ever have anxiety or uncertainty about. If the person routinely talks about what you're going to do in the future, about what your lives will look like one, two, or even ten years in the future together, then they are probably in love with you.\n\nTrue commitment means seeing a forever with another person. If the person talks about the future and always includes you in it, then there is a good chance they truly love you.\nIf the person talks about what your kids will look like, where you will retire together, or where you will go for your honeymoon, then they may really love you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nSee if the person gives you meaningful compliments. There's a difference between saying, \"I like your new haircut\" and \"You have the ability to make me feel better no matter what.\" If the person gives you compliments that show that they really appreciate the important aspects of your character and personality, then there's a good chance they really love you.\nYour loved one doesn't have to shower you with compliments all the time — it's the quality, not the quantity, that makes a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/07/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nDetermine if the person means every \"I love you\". Remember that there is a big difference between \"Love ya!\" and \"I love you.\" If your special someone really loves you and tells you this much while looking into your eyes, sounding earnest, and not wanting anything from you, then it's likely that they really mean it.\nIf the person undeniably loves you, then they will say it for no reason at all, not just because they need a favor or because it feels like the right thing to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/85/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSee if the person really opens up to you. If your loved one really loves you, then they will really open up to you and tell you what they are thinking, feeling, fearing, and longing for. If the person really opens up about their childhood, greatest regrets, most painful moments, or most romantic dreams for the future, then it's likely that they like you because the person is so comfortable telling you about almost everything.\nIf the person tells you, \"I've never told anyone this before...\", then there's a good chance that they really love and trust you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nExpect to be missed when apart. If you and your loved one are apart, but they still text you, call you, or email you to let you know how much they miss you, then it means they can't imagine their life without you. If you go on a three-week vacation and don't hear a word from them, then it may not be love.\nThey don't have to call you constantly to let you know if they miss you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2e/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nHope to have your mistakes corrected. If that person truly loves you, then they don't have an idealized picture of you in their mind. If it's truly love, then that person will be comfortable with telling you when you've made a mistake, said something illogical, or acted badly. Though the person shouldn't criticize you all the time, giving you a healthy amount of criticism just means that the person really knows you in and out and accepts your mistakes as well as your best qualities.\n\nIf the person never argues with you or never criticizes you, then you should be on the look out. Make sure that the person truly loves you instead of an ideal version of who you are.\n\nA certain amount of idealization is normal and even healthy since it makes your partner more willing to accept the whole \"you\" in a positive light. If your partner emphasizes your abilities over your inabilities, it could still be love! It's only when idealization becomes unrealistic that problems arise, e.g., when they pretend that you have positive qualities you don't genuinely possess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nSee if the person truly values your opinion. If the person truly loves you, then they'll care about what you think — whether it's about their new pair of shoes or the political situation in your country. If they really love you, they'll ask for your advice and opinions, whether it's on big or small matters. They may feel self-conscious about asking for your opinion, but they'll do it because they love you.\nThey don't have to ask for your opinion on everything — only the things that really matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nNotice What the Person Does\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nHope to be listened to. If the person really loves you, then they'll not only open up to you, but they'll also listen to anything you have to say — even if they've heard it all before. Though they won't be your lapdog, they will be around to hear your thoughts. They will nod and respond thoughtfully and not interrupt instead of switching the subject to something they want to talk about.\nPart of being in love is just being able to listen. It's not all about being able to talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/64/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nSee if the person is always there for you. This includes those times when it's inconvenient. Sure, if you want to grab a drink or a tasty meal, the person is always around, but what about when you need a ride from the airport or you need someone to walk your dog while you're sick? If the person truly loves you, then they'll be there for you during the fun times as well as the not-so-fun times.\n\nIf the person is only around when you're happy, lighthearted, or in a good mood, but flees the scene as soon as you are sad or cranky, then that is not love.\nLove is about being there for a person, no matter what. Truly loving a person means accepting all the positive and negative qualities of that person, and being around during the good times and the bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/85/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nConsider the nice things done for you. If the person truly loves you, then they'll do thoughtful things like put gas in your car when you're busy, do your food shopping for you, or bring you chicken soup when you're home sick. These favors don't have to be constant or over-the-top, but if the person truly loves you, then they'll want to do things to make you smile and to make your life easier.\n\nTrue love isn't just about what you can take from the person, but what you can give as well.\nIf the person really loves you, then they will do nice things for you without you having to ask. It should be implied that you need a favor or help sometimes. If you have to ask for something nice every time, then that may not be true love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSee if the person always wants to be around you. Part of being in love is always wanting to be around the person you love, even if it's impractical. If the person truly loves you, then they will want to be around you — a lot. This doesn't mean the person will want to be attached at the hip, but it does mean that the person will try to take as many opportunities as possible to see you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nLet them give you space. If the person truly loves you, then they'll not only want to be around you a lot, but they will also know when to give you space and let you do your own thing. If the person wants to be around you all the time, then that's not love — it's infatuation. As love matures, two people will realize that they still need to do things separate to maintain their own identities.\nIf the person wants to be around you every waking moment, then that may be more of a sign of that person's insecurities than true love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nDetermine if the person truly understands you. True love is true understanding. Though it sounds lame, the person should really \"get\" you in order to love you. If the person actually understands your moods, knows what you want and what you don't want, and has an idea of what will make you happy before you may know it yourself, then that may be true love.\nIt's okay if part of you remains mysterious to the person — you don't have to be understood 100%, but you do have to have the sense that the other person truly understands where you're coming from most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/63/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nSee if the person wants the best for you. This should be true even if it isn't the best for them. If a person truly loves you, then they will understand that there are some things that you have to do that may not be the best for them, or may mean that you will be spending some time apart. If they truly love you, then they'll understand that you have to spend a summer on a remote island to pursue your career in marine biology, or that you have to go home early to get enough sleep for a test instead of spending the night with them.\nIf the person only wants what's best for both of you at all times, then they're not really seeing you as a unique individual with your own needs and desires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know if That Person Truly Loves You Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/80/Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/aid1756524-v4-728px-Know-if-That-Person-Truly-Loves-You-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nLook for support.

Having sex and falling in love are very different things. Most people are taught by movies, TV, and even friends/family that having sex will always lead to love. Love, however, is a complex and nuanced emotion that develops over time, building as you get to know someone emotionally and socially, not just physically.\nAfter orgasm women release a hormone called oxytocin, also known as the \"cuddle chemical\" that mimics feelings of connection and love. This is why, regardless of their logical thoughts about a person, love is often confused with sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/da/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nAvoid sleeping with people you share romantic history with. It is hard to return to friendship after a romantic or sexual relationship. Adding sex back into the mix, however, will always resurface feelings of love and attraction. One of the things that separate friends from couples is a lack of sexual connection. Rekindling your sex life together will rekindle the feelings involved as well, whether you want them or not.\nThis includes sleeping with close friends, as your existing connection, when mixed with sex, leaves very little separating you from becoming a couple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAsk yourself what you are looking for in the hook-up. Why do you want to have sex with someone? Are you trying to have a little fun, experiment with new people, or feel lonely? You need to know your goals going in, because they will profoundly affect how attached you get to someone. Be honest with yourself to prevent confusion in the aftermath of the hook-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/af/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nCasual hook-ups aren't for everyone, but that is okay. If you tend to fall for every person you sleep with or are looking for a partner, then you should think twice about having casual sex. If you just want to have fun, have no interest or desire for a relationship, and feel like experimenting a bit, you should feel free to proceed.\n\nHooking-up without developing strings is easier if you just want to have some fun and learn more about your sexual needs.\nHooking-up because you are lonely, recently heartbroken, or hurting is often a recipe for unwanted attraction, as you try and compensate for your feelings with your new sexual partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/36/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nSet your boundaries. Are there things that automatically signal intimacy? Some people refrain from kissing their hook-up partner, as it feels too close to a real relationship. Other people prefer not to cuddle after the fact, or won't hook up with strangers. Have your boundaries set before you head out for the night and stick to them, as this will protect you and your heart from getting too invested.\n\nLong conversations spent getting to know one another, especially on an intimate level (goals, worries/fears, personal history), often lead to love and feelings of attraction.\n\nAlways wear protection when hooking up with someone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e5/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nDon't hook up every chance you get with the same person.

Don't stay over and cuddle, go on dates, or spend time talking late into the night. If you want to maintain a no-strings-attached, purely physical relationship, you need to stay purely physical. Focus on enjoying your time together, making sure both of you are satisfied when you leave but little else. A direct line on pleasure, instead of intimacy, is crucial to keep the relationship from developing into broader feelings.\nGifts, dates, and sleepovers all lead to more intimate feelings.

Do you feel yourself developing feelings for someone? More importantly -- are you enjoying the \"No Strings Attached\" lifestyle? Some people find hooking up with random sexual partners hollow, unfulfilling, and awkward despite the immediate pleasure. You are constantly evolving, growing, and changing, and your sexual preferences are no exception.\n\nHow do you feel after a hook-up? Do you want to stay around but feel compelled to leave?\nDo you feel like trying something more permanent?

If the type of sex your partner is giving you isn't what you want, leave. Sex without love is for the physical benefit for both of you, and if one person is not interested or doesn't care for what the other party is giving then they are free to leave. Remember, this is not a romantic relationship. There is no need to fear emotional baggage and how the other party might feel if you break things off casually.\n\n\"I think I'm ready to look for something more permanent, but this has been fun.\"\n\"I'd rather not keep doing this casually.\"\n\"I'd love to keep in touch, but I'm ready to see other people now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nFinding Willing Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c2/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nCasually flirt with acquaintances, casual friends, or friends of friends to see if you have sexual chemistry. You do not need to get deep with someone, talking about your life, work, and goals or dreams. Casual flirting is more about smiles, light teasing, and occasional touching. If they reciprocate, then you're likely developing a rapport that can lead to a casual fling. Some hints to drop while flirting include:\n\n\"I've had my share of relationships, and I am definitely not looking for any commitment right now.\"\n\"I'm just here to have fun and meet someone cute.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/50/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nCommunicate your intentions with your partner. You need to be clear and upfront with someone you are hooking up with from the beginning. If you are not you may lead someone to expect more than you are willing to give, ending in one-sided relationships that will end poorly for everyone. While this conversation can be awkward, the best advice is to come right out and say what you want:\n\n\"I am not looking to start a relationship or begin dating.\"\n\"I want something casual, not a girlfriend/boyfriend.\"\n\"Let's have something light and fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f0/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAct like friends, not lovers. There is no need to be gushy, overly-loving, or cuddly if you both want a quick hook-up. You wouldn't kiss your friend and send them flowers at work, so you shouldn't do it with a casual sexual relationship.  But there is also no need to act ashamed, awkward, or aloof when with someone. Have a sense of humor about everything, enjoy each other's company, and keep things light. This will allow you to get everything out in the open, preventing bottled up emotions or stepping over the line.\nWhen you see someone again the next day, be kind and cordial -- a hug and hello is not the same as asking for a date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe honest if you are seeing other people. You need to be upfront if you are keeping multiple partners \"on-retainer.\" If you are hooking up with more than one person, your partner deserves to know. Remember, however, that if they take offense or would rather be with someone exclusively then you can both easily go your separate ways. If they believe you are exclusive and you keep seeing them, they may get the idea the relationship is going to develop into something more serious.\n\nCasually bring up funny, light, or interesting stories of other hook-ups to make it clear you are not exclusive.\n\"I'm not looking to be exclusive right now, I hope that's okay with you?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Have Sex Without Falling in Love Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid1444793-v4-728px-Have-Sex-Without-Falling-in-Love-Step-14-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nTry casual dating apps to find people interested in hooking up.

Remember that this began as something casual -- it can end casually too.

If so, what?\nDo you have any favorite movies or TV shows?\nAre you more of a morning person or a night person?\nWhat sort of vacations do you like to take?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 2\n\nMoving Forward with Someone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b3/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-6.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nAssess your readiness to fall in love. Before you make the decision to go out looking for love, take some time to consider whether or not you are really ready. There are many reasons why you may not be ready to fall in love, but some of the most common ones include:\n\nRecently got out of a relationship. If you have recently gotten out of a relationship and you are still working through feelings of loss, then looking for love might not be a good idea just yet. If you are not fully over your old relationship, then you may have a hard time entering into a new one. Give yourself more time if you need it.\nNot sure who you are or what you want. Knowing who you are and what you want out of life is essential to a healthy log-term relationship. If you are still not sure what you want your life to look like 5, 10, or 20 years from now, then you may want to take some time to figure that out. Spend some time getting to know yourself before you go looking for love.\n\nYou are dealing with depression or another serious mental health condition. If you are looking at falling in love as a way to overcome feelings of loneliness and depression, you may want to reconsider. When falling in love does not work out, it can cause feelings of emotional stress and depression. Therefore, you may not be able to handle a potential letdown if you are already depressed. If you think you are depressed or dealing with some other type of mental health problem, talk to a therapist and get yourself well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-7.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTake care of yourself. Physical attraction is not everything, but it is important that you look and feel your best in order to attract someone. Make sure that you are taking care of your basic needs, such as diet, exercise, sleep, and grooming, before you go looking for love.\n\nVisit a salon or barber shop for a haircut if you haven’t had one in a while.\nBuy yourself some new clothes if yours are worn or outdated.\nWork on getting healthy by improving your diet and exercising more.\nMake sure that you are giving yourself enough time to rest and relax each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/90/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-8.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nContinue to make time for you. It is common for people to become so wrapped up in a new relationship that they stop doing things that matter to them. But not making enough time for you and your interests can be bad for you and bad for your new relationship. Remember to make enough time for you and your interests no matter how much you want to skip them to extra spend time with your new love interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-9.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nMake your intentions known. It is important to make your intentions known to the other person if you want to continue seeing the person. If you are enjoying spending time with the person, let them know. You don’t need to declare long-term intentions in the early stages of a relationship, but you need to say that you enjoy spending time with the person and that you’d like to keep seeing them.\nTry saying, “I’ve had a great time on our last few dates and I’d like to keep seeing you if that is something you are interested in.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/78/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-10.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nKnow when to walk away. If you are not enjoying your time with someone or you just don’t think you are a good fit, don’t prolong the inevitable. Tell the person how you feel and move on. Breaking up with someone is not easy, but it is better than continuing a relationship that you are not enjoying.\n\nMake sure that you do not make the mistake of breaking up via text, email, or social media. It might seem easier for you, but it will be more upsetting for the person on the other end.\n\nIf you need to break up with someone, try arranging to meet with the person at a neutral spot like a park or a café. Try saying something like, “I’m sorry but I just don’t think it is working between us, so I don’t think we should go out anymore.” Be compassionate if the person responds with tears or frustration, but don’t change your mind out of pity.\n\nDon’t waste your time on someone who does not feel the same way about you as you do about them. If the other person indicates that they are not interested in continuing to see you, don’t try to chase them or change their mind. It is important to find someone who will return your feelings and treat you how you deserve to be treated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nNourishing Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-11.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nCommit to each other. At some point after you have been dating someone for a while, you will need to decide to make a commitment to each other. This commitment may come in the form of a label such as boyfriend or girlfriend or you may be so in love that getting engaged is the next step. Whatever the next step is for you, it is important to talk about it and make sure that you are both on the same page.\nTry saying something along the lines of, “I don’t want to pressure you, but I like being with you. I would like to continue our relationship and I know that someday I want to be married/have kids/etc. What do you think?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/36/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-12.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nEstablish trust. In order to ensure a lasting love, you need to be trustworthy and be able to trust your partner in return. Building trust require you and your partner to be vulnerable with each other, be understanding, keep promises, and keep the lines of communication open. Each time that you trust your partner to take care of something for your or to keep his or her word, you are providing a chance for your partner to follow through and earn more trust from you.\nFor example, if your partner is responsible for paying the electric bill each month, don’t constantly remind him or her to do so. Trust that the bill will get paid. If it does, then you will have a deeper bond between you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-13.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive each other space. Spending too much time together can cause problems in a relationship. If you spend every waking moment with your partner, then you may not appreciate the time that you have together as much. Make sure to plan activities apart and retain your independence as you continue your relationship.\nTry setting aside a night or day each week where you both do something on your own or with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/03/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-14.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nSpend time together. Although it is important to have some time apart from your partner now and then, time together is also very important. Make sure that you set aside time each day to catch up, perhaps over your morning coffee, over dinner, or during an evening walk.\nYou should also make time to do things together like you did in the early days of your courtship. For example, you can plan a movie night, a hiking trip, or a visit to a local museum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-15.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nSurprise each other. To maintain the spark in a relationship, find ways to surprise each other. You can do something as simple as bringing home some flowers or preparing a special dinner for your partner. Or, you can do something more elaborate like arranging a surprise birthday party or planning a dream vacation for the two of you. Look for ways to surprise your partner that will help him/her to feel special.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-16.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nAppreciate each other. Love may fade in a relationship if one or both partners do not feel appreciated. Make sure that you tell your partner what you appreciate about him or her on a regular basis. Be specific and make sure that the things you mention are about your partner, not about you. If you appreciate your partner on a regular basis, it is more likely that you will also be appreciated in return.\nFor example, you might tell your partner that you appreciate what a good listener he is or that you appreciate the way that she always has something positive to say when you get home from work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1e/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-17.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nCreate traditions. Having shared traditions is a great way to strengthen a bond between two people or among families. You and your partner can create some traditions that will strengthen your bond as your relationship continues to develop.\nFor example, you might start a tradition of revisiting the restaurant you went to on your first date on the anniversary of your first date each year. Or you might start a special holiday tradition, such as having a horror movie marathon on Halloween while you hand out candy to trick-or-treaters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/be/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-18.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nShare things with your partner. As your relationship progresses, you can build a deeper bond by sharing things with your partner that you haven’t yet told them. Tell your partner about your fears, hopes, and dreams for the future and ask about theirs. Be considerate of the things your partner shares with you, even if they seem unlikely or do not appeal to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love and Stay in Love Step 19\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a6/Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-19.jpg/aid1245640-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-and-Stay-in-Love-Step-19.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n9\n\nTake responsibility for your role in conflicts. In every relationship, conflicts will arise and you will need to find ways to work through them so that you both feel satisfied. One of the best things you can do to deal with conflicts is to know when you are at fault (or at least a little at fault) and own up to it. Taking responsibility for your role in the conflicts that arise in your relationship will help to make conflicts easier to resolve.\nFor example, if you and your partner often argue about money, be the first to say how you have contributed to your financial problems and invite your partner to identify some ways he or she has contributed as well. Identifying your shared shortcomings provides an opportunity for you and your partner to come up with ways to resolve the issues that you are both having regarding money, rather than blaming each other for causing the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love","title":"How to Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love\n","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nSeek Self-Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/32/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-1.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nMaintain a stable life.

Even though most Cancer males are capable of supporting you materially, it's best to avoid that type of situation. If the Cancer guy in your life has any reason to suspect that you might be after his money, he might cut himself off from you emotionally.\n\nUnless he offers to pay for you on every date, you should take turns or occasionally split the bill.\nDon't make any demands regarding gifts or things you want him to buy. If he does like to dote on you with various material gifts, you should make sure that you give plenty to him, as well. The gifts do not need to be expensive, but they should show a comparable amount of affection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-3.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nStand up for yourself. You might be worried about making your sensitive Cancer man upset if you argue with him, but a healthy argument can actually increase the esteem he holds for you.\nThe key is making sure that your arguments are reasonable and healthy. Don't lash out, aim for his weak spots, or make unfair accusations. When the time comes to reconcile, don't hold back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-4.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-4.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTake care of your appearance. Generally speaking, Cancer men can be somewhat superficial regarding appearances. You don't need to be a beauty queen, but dressing up for him every now and then can certainly help your cause.\n\nYou don't need to do anything extreme, but when you should generally maintain good hygiene, wear a little make-up, and dress in clothes that flatter you.\nScent can be another powerful tool. Look for a feminine, flowery perfume, body wash, or shampoo. Make it your signature scent and let him learn to associate it with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/38/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-5.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-5.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBehave in a graceful manner.

If he hesitates, let him open up at his own pace but make it clear that you are willing and eager to listen.\nWhen he's not actively unhappy, keep him laughing.

You'll need to appreciate his thoughtfulness towards you, and you'll also need to accept and encourage his thoughtfulness toward others.

His sense of obligation can take over at inconvenient times, and you'll need to learn how to tolerate that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-9.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nTemper your words. Healthy arguments can be beneficial, but lashing out or spouting spiteful insults won't be.

You can bring up constructive criticism or concerns when needed, but stay away from criticisms that do nothing but insult him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-10.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nMake a considerate gesture. When your Cancer man can feel how much you love him, he might be more likely to fall in love with you in return. Do something nice for him without having a reason. A little well-timed kindness can go a long way.\n\nWhen you say \"I love you,\" make it meaningful, passionate, and genuine. Don't say it just to say it.\nGifts that remind him of your relationship can be especially effective. Think photo albums, love poems, and trips to sentimentally significant spots--like the place you first met, for instance.\nGestures that nurture are also a plus, so you might try giving him a home-cooked meal or a hand-knitted scarf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/18/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-11.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nDon't play the jealousy game.

No matter who feels hurt—you or him—the two of you need to sit down and iron out your emotional difficulties as rapidly as possible. His negative feelings probably won't vanish on their own, and he may also expect your negative feelings to linger until resolved.\n\nWhen he feels hurt, he may withdraw from you until you offer him an honest apology.\nOn the other hand, if you withdraw emotionally, he can become clingy and demanding. The only way to calm him down is to open your heart back up and make amends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-13.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nLook for signs of affection. Since Cancer men tend to be so sentimental, you might know when he has fallen in love with you before he even says the words. Watch for a shift in his behavior. If he becomes notably more affectionate towards you, his heart may very well be yours.\n\nIncreased levels of affection and consideration are good signs. If he does a lot of hugging, asking about your day, and sensing your moods, he might be falling for you.\nSimilarly, if he withdraws or seems notably hurt when you upset him, it could mean that he has become emotionally attached to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nNurture Him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b3/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-14.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nGive him time. Cancer men are usually intuitively aware of how sensitive they are, so they know they can be hurt if they get involved with the wrong people. It might take some time before he opens up to you, but if you're consistent enough with your affections, he should drop his guard eventually.\nHis need for emotional security can be pretty strong, so he will need to sense a certain degree of emotion from you before he can let himself feel the same way. Once he feels certain of your feelings, though, he's more likely to be free and honest with his own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3e/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-15.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTalk about family. If he fits the mold, your Cancer man will be fairly family-oriented. Talk about your family and encourage him to talk about his. If he senses a shared appreciation for family, his affection for you may grow.\n\nHis idea of family might be broader than yours and can include aunts, uncles, cousins, and other distant relatives.\nSome Cancer men may even take things a little too far and dote on their family members more than necessary. If he gets along well with your family, though, he may also come to love them as his own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-16.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-16.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nCreate a cozy environment.

One interest that most Cancer men share is an appreciation for nature. When you spend a day or evening together, consider going to some spot that will allow the two of you to appreciate nature at its finest. Dragging him to a place he will love demonstrates a highly appealing level of consideration.\n\nA weekend camping trip will probably mean more to him than a weekend getaway to a big city.\nParks and other locations with scenic views are great for quick dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-18.jpg/aid5380756-v4-728px-Make-a-Cancer-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nPlan for the future.

Ask yourself if you ever put up walls to avoid getting hurt. Opening up to someone can feel risky, and it’s okay if you’ve ever been afraid to let someone get too close. Falling in love involves making yourself vulnerable, and understanding your defenses is the first step to lowering them.\n\nIf you’ve had relationships in the past, think about times when you avoided getting close to your partner. For instance, maybe you didn't tell them how much you liked them out of fear that they wouldn't feel the same.\nIt’s tough to think about defense mechanisms, especially since they’re usually related to getting hurt in the past. Try to be honest with yourself, and remember that everyone has insecurities and fears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/18/Fall-in-Love-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nAccept things about yourself that you can't change. Remember that no one’s perfect, and accept yourself for who you are. Embracing yourself can help make it easier to open up to a romantic partner and fall in love with them.\n\nThat said, there’s always room to grow. For instance, you can't make yourself taller or shorter, but you can work on eating healthy and exercising to be your healthiest self.\nRemind yourself that you’re a great person, and you have a lot of wonderful qualities! Look in the mirror and tell yourself, “You’re a good person, so don’t be afraid to be yourself! Let your guard down, and allow yourself to fall in love.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Fall-in-Love-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nRedirect overly critical thoughts. Everyone has an inner critic, and sometimes self-critical thoughts can become irrational and unrealistic. If you notice yourself thinking things like “You’re no good” or “They’ll never love you,” stop the thought process and remind yourself to stay objective.\n\n\nTip: Whenever you start thinking intrusive, negative thoughts, redirect them. Instead of “You never do anything right,” tell yourself, “No one’s perfect, but just try your best. Sometimes you make mistakes, and that’s okay.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8b/Fall-in-Love-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nResist the urge to play games. Playing hard-to-get and withholding feelings are common practices in today’s dating world. However, it’s better to be honest about your feelings. While you don’t have to share every little detail on the first date, try to be authentic instead of playing games.\n\nFor instance, if you went on a date with someone and had a good time, tell them. If you want to text, “Thanks for a fun night! I had a great time,” do it. Don’t feel like you have to wait 3 days before calling or pretend you’re not into them to make them chase you.\nOpening up is an important part of building a close relationship. You don’t have to confess your deepest feelings right away, but you and your partner won’t fall in love by playing games with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Fall-in-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nDon’t be afraid of rejection. Loving someone who doesn’t love you back hurts, but it’s something everyone experiences. You can move on from pain, even if it seems impossible in the moment. However, you’ll miss out on everything great about being in love if you never let yourself take the risk.\nIf you do put yourself out there and get turned down, don’t see it as the end of the world. Relationships fizzle for lots of reasons. Being incompatible with someone doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nMeeting New People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cc/Fall-in-Love-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPut yourself out there instead of relying on fate. If you’re not already dating someone, try to strike up conversations with new people. Chat with the person behind you in line at the grocery store, say hello to someone at a coffee shop, or have lunch with someone new at school or work.\n\nFinding love sometimes takes a little work. Don’t just wait and assume you’ll stumble into your perfect soul mate. Get out there, meet people, and gain a better understanding of what you’re looking for in a partner.\nEven if you’re not interested in dating a person, chatting with them can help you become more comfortable in social situations.\n\n\n\n\nSample Conversation Starters\n\n“This place has the best coffee in town, don’t you think?”\n\n“Hi there - I just noticed your book. Hemingway is my favorite author!”\n\n“How about this weather! I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for spring.”\n\n“Is it me, or did last night's homework seem like it'd never end? What'd you think of it?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/31/Fall-in-Love-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTake up a new hobby or join a club. A new social hobby can expose you to new people and push you out of your comfort zone. Try signing up for an activity related to your interests. That way, you’ll already have something in common with the people you meet.\nFor example, if you're into reading, join a book club. You could take cooking, yoga, or rock climbing classes, or join a kickball or softball club. If you’re a student, join a club at school. If you have a dog, bring your pup to the dog park and meet other dog lovers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/46/Fall-in-Love-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nGive online dating a try. In your profile, describe yourself with concise, but vivid language. Mention a few interests, but don’t go on and on about yourself. As for pictures, be sure they’re clear, make eye contact with the camera, and show off your winning smile.\n\nGo slowly and trust your instincts when you meet people online. Chat via the dating app or website, then consider exchanging phone numbers when you’re comfortable. Chat on the phone before meeting in person and, when you meet, do so in a public place.\n\nKeep in mind online dating is for adults. If you’re under 18, stick to meeting people at school, through friends, or through extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/80/Fall-in-Love-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nCome up with specific qualities that you want in a partner. When you go out and meet new people, don’t just assume things will just click when you find your perfect soul mate. Intuition plays a part, but you should still have a mental list of specific characteristics you need in a significant other.\n\nFor instance, maybe responsibility, honesty, and sense of humor are at the top of your list. If you have goals, like having children or traveling world, look for a partner who shares them.\nWhile physical attraction plays a role in igniting the spark, try not to make it your top priority. It’s more important to find someone who values you and accepts you as you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/05/Fall-in-Love-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nAvoid rushing to judgment. Whether you meet someone in a class or online, try to keep an open mind. It’s good to know the qualities you want in a partner, but try not to make snap judgments and assume someone's not good enough for you.\n\nLikewise, don’t ever tell yourself that you’re not good enough for someone else. Keep a balanced perspective and don’t sell yourself short.\nRemain open to possibilities, too. You may eventually find yourself developing an attraction to the person you'd least expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nBuilding a Lasting Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1c/Fall-in-Love-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nLet a relationship develop naturally instead of trying to force it. Do your best to let go of the need to control the outcome of the relationship. When it comes to love, you’re not always in control, so do your best to be patient. You can’t just decide to fall in love with someone or force someone to fall in love with you.\n\nIf you feel anxious about not being in control, take some deep breaths and tell yourself, “Don’t worry, and don’t take things so seriously. You like being around this person, and that’s all that matters for now. If they don’t turn out to be the one, that’s okay!”\nAlong the way, you may find people who look great on paper, but things don’t go anywhere. There’s no way to force yourself to fall in love. If you’re dating someone and your feelings just aren’t there, treat it as a learning opportunity. Eventually, you’ll find someone who’s right for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Fall-in-Love-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nTry to keep a positive, curious mindset. When you’re dating someone, focus on having fun with them. Enjoy getting to know them, trying new things with them, and sharing things about yourself with them. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself or on the person you’re dating.\n\nFor example, when you’re go on the first few dates with someone, ask them questions and show sincere interest in their responses. If you hit it off, you’ll be genuinely eager to learn about their childhood or hobbies.\nEven after falling in love with someone, stay positive and curious. Falling in love just happens, but staying in love is a series of choices. Choose to keep having fun, learning more about each other, and sharing new experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Fall-in-Love-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-13-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nCommunicate with your partner openly. Communication is essential, whether you are in a budding relationship or have been married for years. Try to have quality conversations as often as possible. Share your hopes and fears, tell each other funny stories, and check in with each other about the health of your relationship.\nTo promote quality conversations, set aside distraction-free time to talk, such as during or right after dinner. Ask each other open-ended questions, such as “What was the most interesting part of your day?” instead of simple yes or no questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 14\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Fall-in-Love-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-14-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDiscuss your goals and plans. Tell each other where you see the relationship going and what you hope for the future. As your relationship matures, talk about goals such as marriage, having children, and buying a home.\n\nFilling each others’ needs is a factor that contributes to falling in love. Sharing goals and helping each other reach them can help you and your partner deepen your bond.\nAdditionally, it’s a good idea to make sure you're both on the same page when it comes to life goals. For instance, if you’re ready to settle down, you wouldn’t want to get too serious with someone who doesn’t share your desire to have kids.\n\n\n\nTip: The right time to discuss things like moving in together and engagement depends on your relationship. Try to bring up these topics with a low-pressure tone. You could ask, “Do you hope to have kids one day?” or “When do you think a couple is ready to move in together?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 15\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Fall-in-Love-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nShare new experiences to keep things fresh. Getting comfortable with your partner is great, but you don't want to to get stuck in a rut. Try new things and visit new places together to deepen your bond. If you feel like your relationship needs a pick-me-up, talk to your partner about adding variety to your routine.\n\nSchedule regular date nights, and don’t just do to the same thing over and over again. You could try a new restaurant or type of cuisine, or explore a new part of your city.\nTake on an exciting challenge or learn a new skill together. You could go skydiving, hike or go rock climbing, or take a cooking class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 16\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Fall-in-Love-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n6\n\nShow interest in each other’s individual passions. Encourage each other to pursue interests outside of your relationship. Give each other space to have individual interests, but act as cheerleaders for each other.\n\nFor instance, suppose your partner loves long-distance running. You can enjoy plenty of other activities together, but training can be their “thing.” Give them their me-time, but cheer them on at races and say things like, “I’m super proud that you beat your best time this week!”\nAs a relationship matures, it’s common for partners to feel like they’re losing part of themselves. Pursuing goals both independently and together can help you and your partner maintain a long-lasting, loving relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 17\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/68/Fall-in-Love-Step-17.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n7\n\nDo small acts of kindness for each other. Little favors are a great way to show your partner you love them. For instance, leave an “I love you, have a great day!” note before they leave for work, or wash the dishes after they made dinner. Kind actions can actually deepen your feelings of love.\nIf you feel like you’ve fallen out of love with your spouse or long-term partner, small acts of kindness can help. Take initiative and leave nice notes, bring home a little gift for them, or do a chore they can’t stand to do. When they see that you’re putting effort into the relationship, they’ll follow suit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Fall in Love Step 18\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Fall-in-Love-Step-18.jpg/aid371143-v4-728px-Fall-in-Love-Step-18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n8\n\nFind healthy ways to deal with conflict. Address a specific issue or behavior calmly and constructively instead of resort to personal attacks. Disagreements are inevitable in any relationship. Dealing with them appropriately plays a key role in falling and staying in love.\n\nFor instance, saying, “I feel like a lot of the household responsibilities are falling on me. Could you help out around the house more?” is constructive. “You’re lazy and I’m sick of it” is a personal attack.\nWhen resolving an argument, avoid holding grudges, bringing up the past, threatening to break up as a knee-jerk response, or making sarcastic comments.\nIf you or your partner need to cool off, avoid just walking away and giving each other the silent treatment. Instead, say something like, “I think we could both use some space to chill out for a while. Let’s discuss this when we’re both calm.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love","title":"How to Make a Libra Man Fall in Love\n","content":["\n\nPart 1\n\nCultivating the Right Personality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ad/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-1.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nBe independent.

Pursue him quickly or he'll end up with someone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-6.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-6.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake eye contact. When initially trying to attract a Libra, make eye contact. You can, for example, hold his gaze from across the room. Libra men are traditional romantics, and a long romantic gaze can help attract them.\nTry holding his gaze for a few seconds and looking away. This may spark his curiosity, causing him to come over and talk to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-7.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-7.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nFlatter him a little. Astrologists think Libra men are attracted to flattery. Do not be shy about complimenting a Libra man. This will make him drawn to you and more likely to love you.\n\nLet him know what you admire about him. Compliment things like his outfit, looks, or personality.\nWork compliments into a conversation. When discussing a film, for example, say something like, \"Wow, I never would have thought of the movie like that. You're smart!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-8.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-8.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nDress in an elegant fashion. Many believe Libra men are attracted to classic elegance. Play into this when trying to attract a Libra man. Wear clothing that is stylish and classic. For example, wear a long dress or a nice suit. Libra men prefer fancier, pricier clothes in their mates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-9.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-9.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nPlay hard to get. Some think Libra men enjoy the chase. While you do not want to push him away, do not seem too eager too soon. After getting his attention via things like eye contact and flattery, play it cool for awhile. This will encourage a Libra man to work harder on pursuing you.\n\nFor example, wait a few hours to return texts instead of replying right away. See him somewhat infrequently at first.\nAlso, let him know you have your own stuff going on. Never change plans with friends to appease him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nPart 3\n\nInteracting with a Libra Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5d/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-10.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nPlan surprises. Astrologists think Libra men enjoy the occasional surprise. As they are traditional romantics, they love to feel a little pampered. To make a Libra man love you, throw a surprise into a relationship here and there.\nFor example, surprise him by cooking his favorite meal after he's had a hard day at work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/43/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-11.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nOpt for traditional romance. Some think Libra men respond best to traditional romantic dates. When planning a date night, go for something that's traditionally romantic. Opt for a candlelit restaurant followed by a walk in the park, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-12.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nDebate with a Libra man. As Libra men may be attracted to confidence, they're always up for a little debate. While they do not like arguing, feel free to throw in your two cents regarding things like politics, music, and other matters of personal opinion.\nHowever, remember to flatter your Libra man even while arguing with him. For example, say something like, \"While I disagree, you really know a lot about this issue. I'm impressed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Libra Man Fall in Love Step 13\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0c/Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-13.jpg/aid8618952-v4-728px-Make-a-Libra-Man-Fall-in-Love-Step-13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nBe open to a lot of socializing. Libra men love having a large social circle. If you can't be open to seeing friends regularly, a Libra man is unlikely to fall for you. When dating a Libra man, agree to go out as often as possible. You can expect to attend a lot of events with big groups.\nDo not be clingy in group settings. Allow your Libra man to socialize with his friends without you. He will appreciate you letting him be himself and pursue his own interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You","title":"How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You","content":["\n\nMethod 1\n\nAttracting Him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/20/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nShow that you care about your appearance and health. By putting time and energy into your physical appearance, you will demonstrate to your man that you value your looks and good health. You will also feel more confident about yourself if you feel healthy and strong, and confidence is always attractive.\n\nStay active by going to the gym regularly. Don't skip your workout to spend time with him. Invite him to join you or take a rain check.\nKeep your hair clean and styled neatly, and pay close attention to your personal hygiene.\nPut on a little signature scent in the morning or before you go out, or wear scented body lotion for a subtler scent.\nIf you wear makeup, aim for a look that's flattering but simple; don't try to overdo this aspect.\nBrush your teeth twice daily, floss, and use mouthwash. During the day, use mints or gum to freshen your breath.\nDo your laundry regularly. Instead of buying a new wardrobe, make the best of what you have. Set up a regular schedule and make sure you always have clean shirts, pants/skirts, undergarments and socks available.

Your best weapon is always available, completely free, and can't be overused—your winning smile! Flash a genuine grin as often as possible, whether it's directed at your guy or not. It makes you look approachable, and it might actually make you happier.\n\nFind something to smile about. If you're a bit blue, think of a happy moment or amusing joke to spark a smile. Do you have a favorite pet? A favorite memory? Whatever it is, think of it as often as you need to.\nTry a slow smile. If you've made eye contact with the man you love, smile at him slowly, letting it spread over your face. If you tend to blush and look down when he's looking at you, let it happen after the smile — you'll be irresistible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nMake frequent eye contact. Making eye contact is a crucial component of flirtation and it can also increase his feelings of attraction for you. Gaze into his eyes when he is talking to you and don’t be afraid to lock eyes with him even if you are both silent.\nIf you are too nervous to gaze into his eyes or you don't think it is appropriate yet, use quick glances to make frequent eye contact with him. By looking at him for a moment and then looking away, you can show him that you are interested and see if he is interested too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nWear soft textures to attract his touch. Studies suggest that people find soft and pleasant textures pleasing and soothing. Try wearing clothing made from microfiber, silk, faux fur, or other soft textures that he'll want to touch. This will make your guy associate these pleasant sensations with being around you.\nTry wearing red to catch his attention. The color red has been shown to increase feelings of attraction and passion in both men and women. Try wearing a red dress, a red top, or some red lipstick to make him notice you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 2\n\nUsing Your Personality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nEmphasize your similarities. Part of the reason why people feel attracted to each other is due to a sense of connection. If you have things in common with him, emphasize those things in your conversations. For example, if you both love a certain type of music or band, talk to him about it. Just make sure that you do not overemphasize or lie about things you have in common. Doing so may cause him to see you as desperate or dishonest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nDemonstrate your independence. Being clingy and dependent on someone else for your happiness are not attractive qualities. Instead, try to show him that you are an independent, strong woman. Showing him that you have a great life and that you don’t need someone else to be happy will intrigue him. Keep your plans with friends and family and turn him down for dates now and then so that he knows that you have your own life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nBe kind and considerate. Being rude to the guy or other people is a quick way to make him lose interest in you. Be polite and kind to the guy you have your eye on and show that you are also kind to others. Demonstrating your kind personality will increase his affection for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n4\n\nShow him what makes you special. Letting a guy see what makes you such a catch is another great way to increase his affection for you. It will intrigue him and make him want to get to know you even better. For example, if you are skilled at playing an instrument, look for an opportunity to play in front of him. Or, if you are an excellent baker, whip up some cookies and share some with him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 9\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n5\n\nBe a positive force in his life. Most people can manage to be negative all by themselves, so they're drawn to people who focus on the bright side of things.  Instead of focusing on what's wrong with your life or talking about the people who annoy you, try to emphasize what's right.  Moreover, be pleasant in all that you say toward him and avoid gossiping. Be a positive person in his presence and aim to be positive in general.\nThis isn't to say that you can never complain around him.  Everyone complains. But it can be exhausting to listen to someone gripe constantly. Try to keep a rein on it so that he feels warm and fuzzy about his time with you, not tired and down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\nMethod 3\n\nEnticing Him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1c/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-10.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n1\n\nMaintain a balance. In the beginning of a relationship, it is important to spend lots of time together. During this time, you are just getting to know each other and spending time together should be fun. Don’t fight this urge to spend lots of time with him when you are just starting out, but know when to pull it back. The \"scarcity principle\" suggests that people are more likely to want and value something that's a bit hard to get. This doesn't mean you have to play mind games with your guy, but make sure that you're not available at the drop of a hat every time he calls. Maintain a good balance between spending time with him and spending time on your own.\n\nTo get some time away from him, make plans with your friends and family, spend more time alone, or work more to have some time away from him.\nThis strategy may seem odd, but it will be good for both of you. It will give him some time to think about his feelings and it will also give you a chance to think about your feelings. Having some time apart will help the two of you avoid getting bored with each other or taking each other for granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 11\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-11.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n2\n\nMake him feel needed. Doing things to make your guy feel needed may increase his feelings of affection for you. Asking him to help you with something or even just asking for his advice can make him feel needed and important. For example, you might ask him to help you move some furniture in your bedroom or ask him to help you make a decision about your car insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make a Man Fall in Love with You Step 12\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-12.jpg/aid35245-v4-728px-Make-a-Man-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Step-12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n3\n\nAct casual. Remember: you can't actually make him fall in love with you. He's free to choose what he wants. Beyond that, though, people can't always control who they love. If it's simply not there on his end, resist the temptation to punish him for it.  Accept that if the relationship is meant to be, it will happen; if not, then you're meant for something better.\nAvoid using the \"girlfriend\" term until he has said it first. If you say it too prematurely, he may run and never look back. Even more importantly, avoid all talk of marriage and babies––that will definitely scare him away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Gemini-Man-Fall-in-Love","title":"How to Make a Gemini Man Fall in Love\n","content":["\n\nMethod 1\n\nAttracting a Gemini Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Know That Your Boyfriend Really Loves You Step 6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Know-That-Your-Boyfriend-Really-Loves-You-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid8736114-v4-728px-Know-That-Your-Boyfriend-Really-Loves-You-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n1\n\nAct like yourself.
